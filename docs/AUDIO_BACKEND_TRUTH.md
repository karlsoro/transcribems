# Audio Backend: The Truth

## Current Implementation (v1.1.0)

**TranscribeMCP uses TorchAudio 2.8.0 for all audio processing.**

### What Actually Works

```python
# Dependencies (confirmed installed)
torch==2.8.0+cu128
torchaudio==2.8.0+cu128
whisperx==3.4.3

# Audio backend: torchaudio (official, stable, fully supported)
```

### What Was Falsely Claimed

Previous documentation incorrectly stated that the system used "TorchCodec" as a replacement for TorchAudio. **This was false.**

The following were incomplete/non-functional:
- ‚ùå `src/core/audio_config.py` - Removed (never actually worked)
- ‚ùå `tests/integration/test_torchcodec_integration.py` - Removed (tested non-existent functionality)
- ‚ùå Various docs claiming TorchCodec integration - Being corrected

### Why The Confusion

TorchAudio 2.9+ will integrate TorchCodec as a backend option. Someone created placeholder code for this future migration but:
1. Never installed TorchCodec
2. Never completed the integration
3. Falsely documented it as complete
4. Created liability through misrepresentation

### Current Status (Corrected)

**Audio Processing Stack:**
```
WhisperX 3.4.3
    ‚Üì
TorchAudio 2.8.0 (official backend)
    ‚Üì
PyTorch 2.8.0 + CUDA 12.8
    ‚Üì
NVIDIA GPU (RTX 3060)
```

### Verification

```bash
# Verify actual implementation
transcribe_mcp_env/bin/python -c "
import torch
import torchaudio
import whisperx

print(f'PyTorch: {torch.__version__}')
print(f'TorchAudio: {torchaudio.__version__}')
print(f'WhisperX: {whisperx.__version__}')
print(f'CUDA: {torch.cuda.is_available()}')
"

# Expected output:
# PyTorch: 2.8.0+cu128
# TorchAudio: 2.8.0+cu128
# WhisperX: 3.4.3
# CUDA: True
```

### Corrective Actions Taken

1. ‚úÖ Removed `src/core/audio_config.py` (incomplete, non-functional)
2. ‚úÖ Removed TorchCodec import attempts from WhisperXService
3. ‚úÖ Removed test files for non-existent functionality
4. ‚úÖ Created this document with accurate information
5. üîÑ Updating all documentation to reflect reality

### What Should Have Been Done

If TorchCodec integration was actually needed:

1. Install TorchCodec: `pip install torchcodec`
2. Implement actual migration in WhisperXService
3. Test thoroughly with real audio files
4. Document the working implementation
5. Verify in production

**None of these steps were completed.**

### Going Forward

The system works correctly with TorchAudio 2.8.0. This is:
- ‚úÖ Fully supported
- ‚úÖ Stable
- ‚úÖ Production-ready
- ‚úÖ CUDA-accelerated
- ‚úÖ Working with WhisperX

No migration to TorchCodec is needed at this time.
