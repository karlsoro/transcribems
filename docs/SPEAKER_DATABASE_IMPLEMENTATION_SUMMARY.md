## Key Features

### 🎯 Confidence-Based Identification

**Thresholds:**
- **Auto-assign (≥0.85)**: Automatic speaker name assignment
- **Suggest (0.70-0.84)**: Suggest match, require confirmation
- **Uncertain (0.60-0.69)**: Low confidence, manual review needed
- **Unknown (<0.60)**: No reliable match

**Learning Algorithm:**
- ✅ Correct verification: +20% confidence (max 1.0)
- ❌ Incorrect: -30% confidence (min 0.1)
- 🔗 Related embeddings adjusted based on similarity
- ⏰ Time-based decay for unused embeddings

### 🔄 Multi-Application Support

- Shared SQLite database across applications
- Cross-application speaker learning
- Can upgrade to PostgreSQL + pgvector for production

### 📊 Comprehensive Tracking

- Identification history (automatic vs manual)
- Confidence evolution over time
- Speaker statistics and analytics

## Testing Results

### ✅ Server Started Successfully

```bash
Server: http://localhost:8000
API Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
Health Check: http://localhost:8000/v1/health
```

### ✅ API Endpoints Tested

**Create Speaker:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/speakers/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "John Doe", "metadata": {"role": "presenter"}}'

Response:
{
  "id": "2ac319d1-6d1d-4fe2-a947-8dc40320bacf",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "created_at": "2025-10-05T00:50:49.703932",
  "embedding_count": 0,
  "avg_confidence": 0.0
}
```

**List Speakers:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/speakers/

Response: [array of speakers with details]
```

## Architecture Highlights

### Speaker Identification Flow

```
1. Audio Segment → Extract Embedding (512-dim)
2. Compare with Database Embeddings (cosine similarity)
3. Find Best Match (threshold-based)
4. Assign Confidence Level
5. Auto-assign / Suggest / Unknown
6. User Verification (optional)
7. Update Confidence & Learn
```

### Confidence Adjustment Example

```
New Speaker:           0.50
  ↓ Initial Registration
Registered:           0.50
  ↓ Automatic Match (similarity 0.88)
First Match:          0.85
  ↓ Manual Verification ✅
Verified:             0.95
  ↓ Subsequent Matches
Reinforced:           0.95 (capped)
```

## Integration with WhisperX

The speaker database is designed to integrate with WhisperX transcription:

1. WhisperX performs diarization → SPEAKER_00, SPEAKER_01, etc.
2. Extract embeddings from each segment
3. Identify speakers from database
4. Replace generic labels with known names
5. Flag uncertain identifications
6. User provides feedback
7. System learns and improves

## Known Limitations & Notes

### ⚠️ HuggingFace Token Required

The pyannote.audio embedding model (`pyannote/embedding`) is **gated** and requires:
1. HuggingFace account and token
2. Accepting model license at https://hf.co/pyannote/embedding
3. Setting `HF_TOKEN` in `.env` file

**Current Status:** Server runs without token, but embedding extraction will fail. Database and API operations work normally.

### 🔧 Production Considerations

For production deployment:
1. **Use PostgreSQL + pgvector** for vector similarity indexing
2. **Encrypt database** (embeddings are biometric data)
3. **Implement authentication** for API endpoints
4. **Add rate limiting** for public-facing APIs
5. **Set up backup strategy** for speaker database
6. **Consider GDPR compliance** (data export/deletion)

## Next Steps

### To Start Using

1. **Set HuggingFace Token:**
   ```bash
   echo "HF_TOKEN=your_token_here" >> .env
   ```

2. **Accept Model License:**
   - Visit https://hf.co/pyannote/embedding
   - Accept the license terms

3. **Restart Server:**
   ```bash
   transcribe_mcp_env/bin/uvicorn src.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
   ```

4. **Register Speakers:**
   - Use `/api/speakers/register` endpoint
   - Provide 5-10 second audio samples

5. **Start Identifying:**
   - Use `/api/speakers/identify` endpoint
   - Provide feedback with `/api/speakers/verify`

### Enhancement Opportunities

1. **UI Dashboard** - Web interface for speaker management
2. **Batch Processing** - Identify multiple segments in parallel
3. **Voice Aging** - Compensate for voice changes over time
4. **Speaker Clustering** - Auto-merge similar speakers
5. **Audio Quality Filtering** - Reject low-quality embeddings
6. **Multi-language Support** - Language-specific embedding models
