# Implementation Plan - TranscribeMCP MCP Server
**Created**: 2025-09-25T18:26:00Z
**Session ID**: transcribe-mcp-002
**Source**: SPARC Specification - Convert API to MCP Server

## Source Analysis

**Source Type**: Complete feature specification with 58 implementation tasks
**Core Features**:
- MCP server integration with Claude Code
- WhisperX transcription with speaker diarization
- Local processing with file-based persistence
- Progress tracking for large files (>5 minutes)
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Support for 7 audio formats up to 1GB

**Dependencies**:
- Python 3.11+ (required for WhisperX and MCP SDK)
- MCP SDK, WhisperX, asyncio, pydantic, torch/transformers
- librosa/torchaudio for audio format support
- File-based storage (no database required)

**Complexity**: High (58 implementation tasks across 5 phases)

## Target Integration

**Integration Points**: New MCP server replacing existing API architecture
**Affected Files**: Complete new implementation following MCP protocol
**Pattern Matching**:
- TDD approach with tests written first (constitutional requirement)
- Async MCP server with concurrent transcription processing
- File-based storage with JSON persistence
- Local WhisperX processing with model caching

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 3.1: Setup (T001-T003)
- [ ] **T001**: Create project structure with src/, tests/ directories and MCP server package layout
- [ ] **T002**: Initialize Python project with pyproject.toml, MCP SDK, WhisperX, asyncio, pydantic dependencies
- [ ] **T003**: Configure black, mypy, and pytest tools in pyproject.toml

### Phase 3.2: Tests First - TDD (T004-T015)
**CRITICAL: All tests MUST fail before implementation begins**
- [ ] **T004-T010**: MCP tool contract tests (7 parallel tests)
- [ ] **T011-T015**: Integration scenario tests (5 parallel tests)

### Phase 3.3: Core Models (T016-T023)
- [ ] **T016-T023**: Data models for transcription entities (8 parallel tasks)

### Phase 3.4: Service Layer (T024-T028)
- [ ] **T024-T028**: Business logic services (5 parallel tasks)

### Phase 3.5: MCP Tools (T029-T037)
- [ ] **T029-T034**: MCP tool implementations (6 sequential tasks)
- [ ] **T035-T037**: Server infrastructure (3 sequential tasks)

### Phase 3.6: Integration (T038-T045)
- [ ] **T038-T045**: System integration tasks (8 sequential tasks)

### Phase 3.7: Polish (T046-T058)
- [ ] **T046-T058**: Unit tests, performance, documentation (13 parallel/sequential tasks)

## Risk Mitigation

**Potential Issues**:
- MCP SDK compatibility with WhisperX dependencies
- Large file processing (1GB) memory management
- Async processing complexity with progress tracking
- Speaker diarization accuracy requirements

**Rollback Strategy**:
- Git checkpoints after each phase completion
- Incremental commits for logical task groups
- TDD approach ensures working functionality at each step

## Validation Checklist

### Core MCP Features
- [ ] 6 MCP tools properly registered and functional
- [ ] MCP server discovery and connection with Claude Code
- [ ] Structured error responses following MCP protocol
- [ ] Progress tracking for files >5 minutes duration
- [ ] File-based transcription history persistence

### Transcription Features
- [ ] WhisperX integration with speaker diarization
- [ ] Support for 7 audio formats (MP3, WAV, M4A, OGG, FLAC, AAC, WMA)
- [ ] Large file processing up to 1GB with chunking
- [ ] Word-level timestamps and confidence scores
- [ ] Speaker identification and labeling

### Quality Standards
- [ ] All contract tests written first and failing (TDD)
- [ ] 85% minimum test coverage (constitutional requirement)
- [ ] Integration tests for all 5 quickstart scenarios
- [ ] Performance tests for 1GB files and <200ms tool responses
- [ ] Error handling with structured MCP error responses

### Technical Integration
- [ ] Local processing only (no external APIs)
- [ ] File-based storage with JSON serialization
- [ ] Model caching for WhisperX efficiency
- [ ] Concurrent job processing with resource management

## Progress Tracking

**Current Status**: Phase 3.1 - Setup
**Next Task**: T001 - Create MCP server project structure
**Completion**: 0/58 tasks (0%)

**Phase Completion**:
- Setup (T001-T003): 0/3 tasks
- Contract Tests (T004-T015): 0/12 tasks
- Core Models (T016-T023): 0/8 tasks
- Services (T024-T028): 0/5 tasks
- MCP Tools (T029-T037): 0/9 tasks
- Integration (T038-T045): 0/8 tasks
- Polish (T046-T058): 0/13 tasks

## Implementation Notes

**Constitutional Compliance**:
- TDD approach is non-negotiable per constitution
- 85% test coverage minimum requirement
- MCP tool response time <200ms (transcription itself can be longer)
- Code quality gates with complexity limits
- Comprehensive error handling required

**Architecture Decisions**:
- Single project structure (MCP server application)
- Asyncio-based MCP server with concurrent processing
- File-based persistence using JSON storage
- Local WhisperX processing with model caching
- Progress tracking through MCP tool responses

**Key Integration Points**:
1. MCP server initialization and tool registration
2. WhisperX model loading and caching
3. File format detection and audio preprocessing
4. Progress tracking for long-running transcriptions
5. Speaker diarization integration with WhisperX
