# Implementation Plan - WhisperX Audio Transcription API
**Created**: 2025-01-24T11:30:00Z
**Session ID**: transcribe-api-001
**Source**: SPARC Specification Documents

## Source Analysis

**Source Type**: Comprehensive SPARC specification with detailed task breakdown
**Core Features**:
- Audio file transcription with speaker identification
- WhisperX integration with GPU acceleration
- FastAPI REST endpoints with async processing
- Large file support (up to 5GB) with chunked processing
- Real-time progress monitoring via Server-Sent Events
- Comprehensive logging with debug modes

**Dependencies**:
- Python 3.11 (WhisperX compatibility requirement)
- WhisperX, FastAPI, PyTorch, torchaudio, librosa
- Celery + Redis for background task processing
- Docker with CUDA support for GPU acceleration

**Complexity**: High (34 implementation tasks across 5 phases)

## Target Integration

**Integration Points**: New standalone API service with proper project structure
**Affected Files**: Complete new implementation following SPARC task breakdown
**Pattern Matching**:
- TDD approach with tests written first (constitutional requirement)
- Enterprise-grade error handling and logging
- Async processing with queue management
- GPU optimization with CPU fallback

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Project Foundation (T001-T004)
- [x] **Analysis Complete** - Specification review and task mapping
- [ ] **T001**: Create Python 3.11 project structure
- [ ] **T002**: Initialize pyproject.toml with all dependencies
- [ ] **T003**: Configure linting tools (black, flake8, mypy)
- [ ] **T004**: Setup Docker with CUDA support

### Phase 2: Test-Driven Development (T005-T011)
**CRITICAL: All tests MUST fail before implementation begins**
- [ ] **T005-T008**: Contract tests for all API endpoints (parallel)
- [ ] **T009-T011**: Integration tests for user scenarios (parallel)

### Phase 3: Core Data Models (T012-T017)
- [ ] **T012**: AudioFile model with validation
- [ ] **T013**: TranscriptionJob model with state transitions
- [ ] **T014**: Transcription result model
- [ ] **T015**: Speaker model
- [ ] **T016**: SpeechSegment model with timing validation
- [ ] **T017**: ProcessingLog model for audit trail

### Phase 4: Service Layer (T018-T022)
- [ ] **T018**: WhisperX integration with GPU detection
- [ ] **T019**: Audio processing service with chunking
- [ ] **T020**: File validation service
- [ ] **T021**: TranscriptionService orchestrator (depends on T018-T020)
- [ ] **T022**: Memory management service

### Phase 5: API Endpoints (T023-T026)
- [ ] **T023-T025**: Main transcription endpoints (sequential - same file)
- [ ] **T026**: Health check endpoint (parallel)

### Phase 6: Background Processing (T027-T031)
- [ ] **T027**: Celery task workers
- [ ] **T028**: Redis configuration
- [ ] **T029**: Server-Sent Events for progress
- [ ] **T030**: FastAPI application factory
- [ ] **T031**: Error handling framework

### Phase 7: Quality & Polish (T032-T034)
- [ ] **T032**: Unit tests for utilities
- [ ] **T033**: Performance tests with GPU/CPU validation
- [ ] **T034**: End-to-end scenarios from quickstart

## Risk Mitigation

**Potential Issues**:
- WhisperX dependency compatibility with Python 3.11
- GPU memory management for large files (5GB limit)
- Async processing complexity with Celery/Redis integration
- Performance requirements vs constitutional 200ms limit (documented exception)

**Rollback Strategy**:
- Git checkpoints after each major phase
- Incremental commits for each completed task
- Test-first approach ensures working functionality at each step

## Validation Checklist

### Core Features
- [ ] Audio file upload and validation (WAV, MP3, M4A, FLAC)
- [ ] WhisperX transcription with speaker identification
- [ ] GPU acceleration with CPU fallback
- [ ] Large file processing (chunked strategy)
- [ ] JSON output with structured data
- [ ] Real-time progress monitoring
- [ ] Comprehensive logging with debug modes

### API Endpoints
- [ ] POST /v1/transcriptions (file upload)
- [ ] GET /v1/transcriptions/{job_id} (status/results)
- [ ] DELETE /v1/transcriptions/{job_id} (cancellation)
- [ ] GET /v1/health (system status)
- [ ] GET /v1/transcriptions/{job_id}/progress (SSE)

### Quality Standards
- [ ] All tests written first (TDD)
- [ ] 85% minimum test coverage (constitutional requirement)
- [ ] Integration tests for all endpoints
- [ ] Performance tests for stated requirements
- [ ] Error handling with proper HTTP status codes
- [ ] Logging follows enterprise standards

### Technical Integration
- [ ] Docker containerization with GPU support
- [ ] Celery workers for background processing
- [ ] Redis job queue management
- [ ] Memory management for large files
- [ ] File system organization (uploads, transcriptions)
