**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "adjust the current project from an API to an MCP"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-25
- Q: What audio formats should the MCP server support for transcription? → A: All common formats (MP3, WAV, M4A, OGG, FLAC, AAC, WMA)
- Q: What is the maximum file size limit for audio files? → A: 1GB (very large files)
- Q: At what point should the system provide progress updates for transcription? → A: Files over 5 minutes duration
- Q: Which transcription backend should the MCP server integrate with? → A: WhisperX
- Q: What information should be included in transcription results beyond the text? → A: Text + timestamps + confidence + speaker labels

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Claude Code users need to interact with TranscribeMCP transcription capabilities directly through the Model Context Protocol, allowing seamless integration of audio/video transcription features within their coding environment without requiring separate API endpoints or external service calls.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** Claude Code is running with TranscribeMCP MCP server enabled, **When** a user requests transcription of an audio file, **Then** the transcription is processed and returned directly in the Claude Code interface
2. **Given** a user has multiple audio files in their workspace, **When** they request batch transcription through Claude Code, **Then** all files are processed and results are accessible within the coding environment
3. **Given** TranscribeMCP MCP server is configured, **When** Claude Code starts up, **Then** transcription tools are automatically available without additional setup steps

### Edge Cases
- What happens when audio files are in unsupported formats?
- How does the system handle large audio files that exceed processing limits?
- What occurs when the MCP server is unavailable or crashes during transcription?
- How are processing errors communicated back to Claude Code users?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide MCP-compliant server interface that Claude Code can discover and connect to
- **FR-002**: System MUST expose transcription capabilities through MCP tools that can be called from Claude Code
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to transcribe audio files directly from their workspace through Claude Code commands
- **FR-004**: System MUST handle file path resolution between Claude Code workspace and transcription processing
- **FR-005**: System MUST return transcription results with text, word-level timestamps, confidence scores, and speaker labels in Claude Code's tool response format
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain transcription history and allow retrieval of previous results through MCP tools
- **FR-007**: System MUST support all common audio formats (MP3, WAV, M4A, OGG, FLAC, AAC, WMA)
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle audio files up to 1GB in size and reject larger files with clear error messages
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide progress updates for audio files over 5 minutes duration during transcription processing
- **FR-010**: System MUST integrate with WhisperX for local transcription processing with speaker diarization capabilities

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **MCP Server**: Represents the TranscribeMCP service endpoint that implements Model Context Protocol specifications
- **Transcription Tool**: Individual MCP tool definitions that expose specific transcription capabilities to Claude Code
- **Audio File**: Input files that need transcription, with metadata about format, size, and location
- **Transcription Result**: Output containing transcribed text with word-level timestamps, confidence scores, speaker diarization labels, and processing metadata
- **Tool Response**: MCP-compliant response format that carries transcription data back to Claude Code
