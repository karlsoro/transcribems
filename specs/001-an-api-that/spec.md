# Feature Specification: WhisperX Audio Transcription API

**Feature Branch**: `001-an-api-that`
**Created**: 2025-01-24
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "an API that will take the input of the path to a audio file and then will read that audio file and use whisperX to create a transcription file with the speakers identified (speaker 1, speaker 2, etc) and the start and end time makers as a file. The API will leverage a GPU if one is available. There should be logging as well and a debug flag to allow setting the level of the verboseness of the logging"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A developer or system administrator needs to transcribe audio files containing multiple speakers with precise timing information. They submit an audio file path to the API, which processes the file using advanced speech recognition technology and returns a structured transcription file that identifies different speakers and includes timestamp markers for each spoken segment.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a valid audio file path, **When** the API is called with the file path, **Then** a transcription file is generated with speaker identification and timestamps
2. **Given** an audio file with multiple speakers, **When** transcription is requested, **Then** speakers are identified as Speaker 1, Speaker 2, etc. with clear segment boundaries
3. **Given** a debug flag is enabled, **When** processing occurs, **Then** detailed logging information is output showing processing steps
4. **Given** a GPU is available on the system, **When** transcription is requested, **Then** the API automatically utilizes GPU acceleration for faster processing
5. **Given** an invalid or inaccessible file path, **When** the API is called, **Then** an appropriate error message is returned with details logged

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the audio file format is unsupported or corrupted?
- How does the system handle very large audio files that might exceed memory limits?
- What occurs when no speech is detected in the audio file?
- How does the system respond when only one speaker is present?
- What happens when GPU acceleration fails or is unavailable?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept a file path parameter pointing to an audio file
- **FR-002**: System MUST read and process audio files to generate transcriptions
- **FR-003**: System MUST identify different speakers in the audio and label them sequentially (Speaker 1, Speaker 2, etc.)
- **FR-004**: System MUST include precise start and end timestamps for each speech segment
- **FR-005**: System MUST output transcription results to a structured file format
- **FR-006**: System MUST automatically detect and utilize GPU acceleration when available
- **FR-007**: System MUST implement comprehensive logging of processing steps and errors
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide a debug flag to control logging verbosity levels
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate input file paths and handle invalid paths gracefully
- **FR-010**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which audio formats - MP3, WAV, M4A, FLAC?]
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle audio files up to [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: maximum file size not specified]
- **FR-012**: System MUST complete processing within [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: acceptable processing time limits not specified]
- **FR-013**: System MUST store transcription files at [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: output directory/path not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Audio File**: Input audio file containing speech from one or more speakers, with file path, format, duration, and quality metadata
- **Transcription**: Output containing the text transcription with speaker identification, timestamps, and confidence scores
- **Speaker**: Identified voice in the audio, labeled sequentially with associated speech segments
- **Speech Segment**: Individual portion of transcribed speech with start time, end time, speaker ID, and text content
- **Processing Job**: Represents a transcription request with status, input file reference, output file reference, and processing metadata
