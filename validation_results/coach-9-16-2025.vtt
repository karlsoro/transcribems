WEBVTT

00:03.642 --> 00:25.752
maybe let's give one more minute for Vishal to join in then he gets started so today we wanted to talk about okay it is Satish who has joined okay

00:26.356 --> 00:39.218
We wanted to talk about the taxonomy and after that we also wanted to touch upon what are the outcomes that we are planning to achieve.

00:39.687 --> 00:41.269
by end of the vision statement.

00:41.829 --> 00:42.670
There was a discussion.

00:42.730 --> 00:44.813
There's a thought Prashanti has shared that with us.

00:44.833 --> 00:46.154
She's looking for three things.

00:46.194 --> 00:53.703
One is the vision statement, then L2, L3 capabilities and the mapping to the respective application.

00:53.943 --> 00:55.105
So that's the three things.

00:55.185 --> 01:02.353
But then here is the first step like building that the standing and modifying the content for the vision workshop tomorrow.

01:02.333 --> 01:03.095
accordingly.

01:03.375 --> 01:05.099
That's the plan.

01:05.119 --> 01:09.189
So Kaal, I think we have full house, Anuj may not be able to join.

01:09.249 --> 01:10.793
He has some medical emergency.

01:11.334 --> 01:12.276
That's what he shared.

01:12.396 --> 01:15.263
So we can get started.

01:15.597 --> 01:16.419
over to you.

01:16.439 --> 01:17.220
We are all yours.

01:17.420 --> 01:17.721
Sure.

01:18.282 --> 01:18.523
Sure.

01:18.543 --> 01:24.935
I mean, and a lot of what we were covering was, I mean, it seems to be that there's people don't know what a business capability is or how business capability maps are.

01:25.336 --> 01:29.944
I'm not looking at what our business capability map is, because there's still some stuff up in the air there.

01:30.065 --> 01:34.433
We had some conversation over the last couple of days of

01:35.830 --> 01:46.402
There is a version in Lean IX, which currently is considered the Kenview version, but there's also some discussion about whether or not the Lean IX version is right or not, so we'll continue to have those discussions.

01:47.123 --> 01:52.509
But my bigger thing is understanding what a business capability map and how it works into the product model.

01:52.569 --> 01:55.372
What does a business capability map have to do with a product model?

01:56.133 --> 01:58.796
They are very, very much linked.

01:59.417 --> 02:04.302
And by definition, if you look at the design of a product model by anybody

02:05.243 --> 02:08.306
Actually, I was just looking yesterday at seven different product models.

02:08.666 --> 02:09.587
There's seven different versions.

02:09.627 --> 02:13.831
The product model that I've been able to locate, of the seven, every single one of them uses.

02:13.891 --> 02:21.677
Sorry, I just got some, the bing that you have to pay attention to.

02:22.418 --> 02:30.685
In the product model, what they're doing in a lot of cases is what you're doing exactly what we're looking at.

02:30.805 --> 02:33.748
When you talk about a line to a group,

02:34.167 --> 02:35.469
to a team.

02:36.470 --> 02:38.093
You're looking at capabilities.

02:38.493 --> 02:41.598
A line is a high level, a level one capability.

02:41.678 --> 02:46.445
A product group is a level two capability and a level three capability is a team.

02:47.025 --> 02:48.648
That's why they're defined the way they are.

02:49.669 --> 02:52.293
We had a definition that was used to category software.

02:52.754 --> 02:54.156
We're changing from that definition.

02:54.276 --> 02:55.357
We're moving out of that definition.

02:55.377 --> 02:57.741
There's a copa version that was used there.

02:58.161 --> 03:00.765
Copa is a standards organization.

03:00.745 --> 03:05.012
the standards organization of the CPG business is what it's from.

03:05.893 --> 03:06.714
We won't be using that one.

03:06.815 --> 03:08.057
There are some changes from there.

03:09.319 --> 03:12.283
There's a couple other models that are out there that are fairly common.

03:12.844 --> 03:19.234
About five of them use the same model, but for the most part there's different models.

03:19.675 --> 03:27.968
So I'm intentionally going to use a graphic from, and I will share in a second as soon as I find it,

03:28.133 --> 03:30.656
A graphic that's... this is how it looks.

03:30.676 --> 03:31.617
This isn't ours.

03:32.418 --> 03:33.599
It has nothing to do with ours.

03:33.759 --> 03:41.168
I don't want to use ours for a very good reason, is that ours is up in the air and I don't want people to get confused by what's going to be there.

03:42.910 --> 03:45.453
So, if I can just find this stupid thing.

03:46.654 --> 03:48.176
I will share it.

03:50.679 --> 03:51.459
Alright, where did it go?

03:51.500 --> 03:56.205
That's not the one.

03:56.685 --> 03:58.107
That is ours, okay.

03:58.610 --> 04:07.360
And I am working currently on, as part of another process, I'm working on what ours will look like somewhat.

04:07.500 --> 04:16.190
I need to get agreement from a couple of people before I can say so, because whether we're gonna have one or two and things like that, because there's a lot of different thought processes out there.

04:16.590 --> 04:19.433
So, where did it go?

04:20.274 --> 04:20.955
There it is, okay.

04:22.116 --> 04:23.138
Now I have to go back to sharing.

04:23.758 --> 04:25.360
I had to find it before I could share it.

04:27.888 --> 04:47.287
The fun of working on a Mac is you have multiple screens, and I can't find the stupid thing on the screen I want it to be on.

04:48.508 --> 04:50.530
Alright, I'll open it again.

04:50.550 --> 04:52.692
I can't show it.

04:52.712 --> 04:54.013
Alright, let me try this.

04:54.331 --> 04:56.858
if I share my entire thing just because it's easier that way.

04:58.723 --> 05:01.972
And then you can tell me whether or not you can see it when I get it.

05:02.213 --> 05:03.657
Where'd it go?

05:03.677 --> 05:03.918
All right.

05:03.998 --> 05:05.101
If I share my screen, can you see that?

05:05.462 --> 05:06.966
Are you seeing a big box?

05:06.986 --> 05:07.748
Okay.

05:08.390 --> 05:08.932
Cool.

05:08.952 --> 05:09.253
All right.

05:09.373 --> 05:10.095
Now.

05:10.312 --> 05:13.719
When I talk about L1s, then this is where you'll start to see where things happen.

05:13.739 --> 05:20.151
When you talk about L1s, where you see operating processes here or management and support processes, those are L1s.

05:20.532 --> 05:29.449
Those usually have a VP over them at a VP level that would be responsible for operating processes and what the goals are for that operating processes group.

05:30.210 --> 05:32.134
So if we were to look at

05:32.435 --> 05:33.897
probably Eleanor is the best mix.

05:34.058 --> 05:44.614
Eleanor and our company has enterprise services, which includes corporate services and it includes supply chain, which is sometimes done, sometimes not.

05:44.674 --> 05:45.776
It's a little unique on its own.

05:46.958 --> 05:53.228
But what comes in after that normally would then be where do you take the things that are inside of?

05:53.596 --> 05:54.438
enterprise services.

05:54.478 --> 05:56.383
So enterprise services has a lot of different systems.

05:57.105 --> 05:59.692
Okay, we have a lot of different things, but they're grouped together.

05:59.772 --> 06:02.559
So maybe we were to say is I'm going to do corporate systems.

06:04.384 --> 06:07.692
Now the thing that gets lost quite often is you can have multiple capabilities under there.

06:07.732 --> 06:10.339
So you might say corporate systems is one of these boxes.

06:12.057 --> 06:13.380
Well, what do we have in corporate systems?

06:14.102 --> 06:15.566
Well, we can have finance systems.

06:15.626 --> 06:16.769
We can have HR systems.

06:16.829 --> 06:18.213
But what is the capability?

06:18.273 --> 06:19.015
What are they doing?

06:19.596 --> 06:27.957
So if I were to look at HR and say, what are the actual capabilities that would make up these blue boxes in this case?

06:27.937 --> 06:33.164
I would look at things like if I said I was in corporate systems and I had capabilities inside corporate systems.

06:33.204 --> 06:36.908
Now HR can be grouped in there as its own or as something different.

06:37.008 --> 06:38.670
You could make HR one of these boxes.

06:39.672 --> 06:40.553
People do it different ways.

06:40.813 --> 06:44.978
So if we were to say HR was one of these yellow blocks, HR has capabilities.

06:45.239 --> 06:48.142
You have core HCM, which is things like workday.

06:48.983 --> 06:52.808
You have compensations, which could be in total reward.

06:54.670 --> 06:56.813
You could have

06:58.885 --> 07:02.454
talent recruiting, which is another part of all of that.

07:02.875 --> 07:07.987
Now those would normally have a leader in the yellow box, in that case it would be Jessica in our case because we've dealt with Jessica.

07:08.308 --> 07:11.275
And the blue box is what you would see is the

07:11.491 --> 07:13.795
folks that we're working with, and I can't remember what her name is.

07:14.215 --> 07:15.598
Generally, it would actually be somebody more.

07:15.758 --> 07:18.803
Now, we have an extra layer in the corporate end of the world.

07:19.204 --> 07:20.606
So we do have extra people in there.

07:21.227 --> 07:24.913
But if we were to split off HR on its own, we wouldn't.

07:24.953 --> 07:28.058
If we said HR and compensation is that, then you'd have just owning two boxes.

07:28.679 --> 07:29.881
That's why it gets confused.

07:30.322 --> 07:37.954
But what we're trying to do is say is, what I need to know is, what are my high level lines so that I have a leader here that's

07:38.373 --> 07:41.317
aligning with that business side of that.

07:41.337 --> 07:43.601
These don't just apply to technology.

07:43.641 --> 07:45.083
They apply to technology and business.

07:45.964 --> 07:57.400
So if I were to be able to apply both of them and say, okay, in the business, we have a set of goals, those goals come cascading down when we talk about cost savings.

07:57.801 --> 08:01.326
Maybe at operating process, we want to save

08:03.095 --> 08:07.242
50 million dollars and we have six boxes here.

08:07.763 --> 08:19.404
We may split that six boxes into six parts and say you each have to do one or we may do it unevenly because of the impact each group has.

08:19.464 --> 08:21.408
That would be where that cascaded goal would come from.

08:21.488 --> 08:26.757
So the vision of operating processes is to shorten work times and reduce costs.

08:27.462 --> 08:29.324
Okay, that vision is gonna cascade down.

08:29.804 --> 08:38.171
It's gonna cascade down to the things, what impact they can have, then those will get down to the team level to say which individual team should be supporting in what level.

08:38.632 --> 08:40.093
So the goal doesn't change.

08:40.914 --> 08:45.117
The portion of the goal that the teams can actually impact changes.

08:46.859 --> 08:48.460
So that's when you're looking at your vision.

08:48.500 --> 08:49.661
The vision doesn't change.

08:49.762 --> 08:54.025
The vision becomes specified much more detailed to what you can do.

08:54.946 --> 08:57.148
So if they said, yeah, go ahead.

08:58.006 --> 09:00.328
question for you.

09:00.348 --> 09:09.836
Can we say that this is a guideline for teams to define what their L1 capabilities are?

09:11.658 --> 09:18.024
Well, L1 is a product line.

09:18.864 --> 09:22.928
Teams wouldn't define what their product line is.

09:23.648 --> 09:27.692
Corporate systems, if you were going into who's going first?

09:28.465 --> 09:29.886
Who's going tomorrow?

09:31.828 --> 09:48.304
Okay, so you may be looking at, you know, research and development as being the product line, which is probably, may or may not be part of operations, but that's okay.

09:48.324 --> 09:56.532
So let's assume that R&D was this thing, rather than operating processes, this said research and development, and you were going into the lab services.

09:57.440 --> 10:01.007
There could be two teams, there could be three teams, there could be multiple software packages.

10:01.508 --> 10:11.148
So their L1 would then be R&D, their L2 would be lab services, and their individual teams, limbs being one of them, would be an L3.

10:11.269 --> 10:18.283
So then the level three capability is lab, I forget what limbs does now, lab monitoring and notebooking.

10:19.343 --> 10:27.551
So how do I translate this into business capabilities that I'm trying to like I'm maybe just as me.

10:27.571 --> 10:33.076
Well, yeah, again, it's this is where we run into a problem here at Kenview because we haven't really settled on something.

10:33.096 --> 10:38.361
There are industry definitions that say this is the capabilities that you do in the company.

10:39.081 --> 10:43.105
We can use those or we can use what they define if they want to call limbs.

10:44.066 --> 10:46.228
I am the lab management platforms.

10:46.698 --> 10:47.039
Okay.

10:47.239 --> 10:48.281
Your lab management platforms.

10:48.301 --> 10:49.403
Do you have any more than one system?

10:49.623 --> 10:50.024
Maybe not.

10:50.485 --> 10:51.427
It's possible they don't.

10:52.128 --> 10:54.032
It could be their lab management platforms.

10:54.072 --> 10:56.376
Then their blue box would say lab management platforms.

10:58.941 --> 11:00.003
Which is fine.

11:00.063 --> 11:03.148
I mean, they can define whatever they want to put there.

11:03.389 --> 11:10.562
The problem I think we have right now is that we have multiple places where we've already gathered this information multiple times.

11:10.863 --> 11:12.265
and everybody's getting different answers.

11:12.967 --> 11:17.334
So we have to figure out who is the source of truth or what is the source of truth and stick to one.

11:17.955 --> 11:21.301
So right now what I'm using is what actually happens to be in Lean IX.

11:22.283 --> 11:28.153
So if I were to look at what's in Lean IX, Lean IX has a set of things.

11:28.193 --> 11:28.975
Let me see if I can find it.

11:29.135 --> 11:30.998
I probably can because I think I had it open.

11:31.957 --> 11:37.014
I think she just stepped out as well.

11:37.174 --> 11:44.177
What I understood here is the L1 is kind of equivalent to the product line.

11:44.798 --> 11:49.582
That's what we are seeing it, which particularly talks about what your product does.

11:50.463 --> 11:51.984
Not product, product line does.

11:52.144 --> 11:53.626
That's what in combination.

11:54.146 --> 11:54.947
That's what it is.

11:55.087 --> 11:57.749
And then we have not tested upon L2 and L3.

11:57.789 --> 12:00.572
But who defined these L1, L2, L3?

12:00.612 --> 12:04.375
Who are the responsible person who has to define these?

12:05.956 --> 12:08.639
Well, right now what we have is, I don't even actually know.

12:08.739 --> 12:13.523
I mean, architecture worked with a bunch of senior leaders to come up with a number of definitions.

12:14.802 --> 12:19.208
So that is who defined the ones that we have.

12:19.228 --> 12:21.891
So can you see a business capability index I have for Lean IX here?

12:24.094 --> 12:25.936
I can see the screen.

12:26.297 --> 12:35.289
Okay, so if I look at this, now if I look at the L ones that they have defined, you would look at this and say, okay, here, my product line is R&D and engineer.

12:37.972 --> 12:38.873
Makes sense, right?

12:39.033 --> 12:40.275
It's a rational thing, because it's there.

12:40.315 --> 12:41.417
Those are already defined.

12:42.278 --> 12:44.100
Normally there's eight, we have 33.

12:45.903 --> 12:50.189
Then if I came down again a little level down to L2s, now I would see is okay.

12:50.209 --> 12:51.051
Well, there's a bunch of them.

12:51.111 --> 12:52.272
So wait, this is limb.

12:52.292 --> 12:55.517
So this is going to be, you know, 21 too.

12:55.657 --> 12:58.802
So it was the R&D in engineering and lab management.

12:59.002 --> 13:02.628
Now, if I want to get to level three, cause they have an additional level here.

13:02.648 --> 13:07.515
And theoretically this is an additional level because they're, they missed them.

13:07.535 --> 13:12.923
Oh, but let's, then I come down to 21.

13:15.822 --> 13:21.430
Now they could be limbs itself could be one of these lab management data.

13:21.491 --> 13:24.275
So maybe they're 2123 lab data management.

13:27.119 --> 13:32.828
And they're different than whoever is doing lab data visualization or real material management or any of the other management.

13:33.549 --> 13:38.857
So assuming that these are the correct ones because these are the ones that are set up currently in lean IX.

13:39.478 --> 13:41.521
And they're pretty adamant about keeping them that way.

13:41.561 --> 13:42.943
They're not going to change them at this point.

13:43.565 --> 13:45.627
So just one question, Karl.

13:46.348 --> 13:49.972
I think, at least let's take the example of R&D.

13:51.614 --> 13:58.803
I'm not sure if you have access, maybe we can look at it, download and see what Linaix has.

13:59.363 --> 14:07.352
But my understanding is Chris Smith has already defined his L1, L2, L3 capabilities.

14:08.093 --> 14:10.416
And based on what I'm hearing,

14:11.510 --> 14:14.134
I mean, there's nobody else deciding these things.

14:14.154 --> 14:16.998
It's us or it's them, right?

14:17.098 --> 14:24.048
We have not taken a stab and said, Brian has not told us saying that we'll go with the industry best practices.

14:24.269 --> 14:26.892
Somebody at his level has to make a decision.

14:27.053 --> 14:29.556
This is the Lean IX data that we're looking at right now.

14:29.576 --> 14:31.219
This is not industry best practices.

14:31.699 --> 14:34.243
This specifically is Lean IX.

14:34.564 --> 14:36.807
Okay, let me see what I have.

14:37.428 --> 14:40.993
I have what Chris gave me was one second.

14:43.117 --> 14:48.327
He has given, if you don't mind I'll steal the chair for one second and I'll give it back to you.

14:48.968 --> 14:49.749
Okay.

14:49.769 --> 14:53.075
This is what he has given me unless it has changed.

14:53.115 --> 14:58.425
I don't know what's the latest, but this is what he's saying is art is.

14:59.266 --> 15:02.270
These are his L2 capabilities, these are the L3.

15:02.671 --> 15:10.102
So according to him, these are the product, no, I think this is product line, product groups and products.

15:10.403 --> 15:11.925
This is how they are looking at it.

15:12.306 --> 15:18.675
And then maybe LIMS falls under regulatory, I don't know, regulatory or clinical, I'm not sure.

15:18.655 --> 15:21.960
But this is what I was expecting to see in Linux.

15:22.380 --> 15:28.509
If this is not matching, then we need... And that will never end up in Linux because those aren't actual categories.

15:28.549 --> 15:34.097
Those are actually... Medical safety is not a category because it could fit in 50 different places.

15:35.760 --> 15:37.723
It's not going to show up in capabilities.

15:37.783 --> 15:43.431
Now, what Chris has here, my understanding is he got this agreed upon with senior leaders.

15:44.288 --> 15:45.330
we're following up.

15:45.370 --> 15:46.492
I had a conversation with Brian on it.

15:46.512 --> 15:48.455
We're having some follow-up with it on it already.

15:48.516 --> 15:55.528
But the idea was, do we adapt to what Lean IX is saying, or do we let every single group do it the way they want to do it?

15:55.608 --> 16:02.781
Because the problem that we have, and I think it's a little off track of the conversation we're having here, because we can let them tell us anything they want.

16:03.222 --> 16:05.706
We have to make a decision on what

16:05.686 --> 16:06.828
chart we're going to use.

16:07.188 --> 16:09.331
There's a hundred charts out there.

16:09.352 --> 16:11.314
Unfortunately, I'm stopping my share.

16:11.695 --> 16:14.700
If you give me that list, I'm going to take both of them.

16:14.740 --> 16:22.571
I'm going to send it to Chris Smith and Chris Cerito, coffee, Brian, you and Sarah, and say, pick one.

16:22.591 --> 16:23.493
We are moving forward.

16:23.513 --> 16:25.295
Yeah, and Brian and Sarah already have this.

16:25.356 --> 16:28.701
Because unfortunately, I am not getting that empowerment.

16:28.721 --> 16:30.023
Okay, it's already on Brian's desk.

16:30.063 --> 16:30.904
Brian already has it.

16:30.924 --> 16:32.727
He's had it for a few days and he's going through it.

16:32.847 --> 16:33.668
So

16:33.648 --> 16:36.712
You can check on his status with it and let's go that way.

16:36.832 --> 16:43.181
Can you just give me the two letters R and D and then shall both of them R and D?

16:43.201 --> 16:44.143
But it's actually not that.

16:44.163 --> 16:46.846
What I'm trying to do is explain why we do it the way we do it.

16:47.167 --> 16:48.469
What chart we use doesn't matter.

16:48.569 --> 16:50.591
And I don't want to go too far off of what chart.

16:51.032 --> 16:52.995
We know there's questions of which chart we're going to use.

16:53.075 --> 16:55.318
I don't want to get stuck in that.

16:55.585 --> 16:59.192
The idea is we keep talking about business capabilities.

16:59.653 --> 17:06.427
For us, if we ask people to map to some capabilities, we have to give them capabilities to say map it, right?

17:06.808 --> 17:09.533
Now, which capability will put in front of them?

17:09.553 --> 17:11.417
We try to put whatever is at risk.

17:11.397 --> 17:32.595
aligned and then if they want to throw some dots evolve that that's up to them but at this point of time the direction I've got is don't disrupt anything if there's something already existing just go with it that's the strong direction I have received but but I might be wrong there might be something else that's going on right now

17:32.575 --> 17:37.905
This team is looking for cardless, not like, hey, maybe this or that.

17:38.025 --> 17:41.732
We need to go with one list so that they can finish the activity of mapping.

17:41.752 --> 17:47.483
Because if we put two lists in front of Rajini and say, hey, ask them, they can map here.

17:47.583 --> 17:48.385
This is better.

17:48.405 --> 17:50.549
This is Chris says, you can map here.

17:50.609 --> 17:52.092
This is what Chris Smith says.

17:52.533 --> 17:54.035
It will be very confusing to them.

17:54.055 --> 17:55.478
We need to give them one list.

17:55.458 --> 17:58.026
Let Chris Smith and Chris said it or fight it out.

17:58.668 --> 18:03.544
One list comes out of it and that list goes to this training as simple as that.

18:04.402 --> 18:06.966
And Prishanthi, I have a follow up question on that.

18:06.986 --> 18:11.272
So you have shared that, you know, that slide that we have it from long, right?

18:11.933 --> 18:13.536
It talks about L2L3.

18:13.916 --> 18:20.466
So when we are in a workshop, are we asking the business to verify it, whether this is correct or not?

18:20.786 --> 18:23.450
Because it's the audience.

18:23.631 --> 18:27.436
Whoever we have invited, I'm assuming they are the decision makers over there.

18:27.877 --> 18:29.579
It could be the technical leader.

18:29.599 --> 18:31.202
It could be the business.

18:31.342 --> 18:32.704
It's a collaborative thing.

18:32.684 --> 18:40.354
If they are saying, hey, this application, hey, there is this, whatever, ana plan, this is the demand planning.

18:40.754 --> 18:45.500
Yes, the technical person is saying this, does the business person agree?

18:46.001 --> 18:47.583
Are his capabilities delivered?

18:47.803 --> 18:50.807
Do they use ana plan for supply planning?

18:50.847 --> 18:51.949
That's the biggest question.

18:52.229 --> 18:56.194
If yes, yes, yes, that's the application.

18:56.596 --> 18:59.701
That's the capability, that's how you manage it.

18:59.721 --> 19:04.428
And then we might be just talking about one product here because we are just talking pioneers.

19:04.809 --> 19:10.257
But ideally, like Karli is saying, we should do top-down, but we are not in that space.

19:10.277 --> 19:11.439
We are doing bottom-up.

19:11.780 --> 19:21.675
So maybe in that entire hierarchy, it's only one box you're going to pick up and say, hey, these two applications, we have been talking about maps to the supply plan.

19:21.993 --> 19:22.413
That's it.

19:23.034 --> 19:24.456
You mapped it, done.

19:25.076 --> 19:27.459
Then you say, okay, the product, whatever.

19:28.380 --> 19:32.845
Finalize the name, finalize the L2 capability, finalize the applications.

19:32.965 --> 19:36.269
That's your two-way mapping, right?

19:37.110 --> 19:38.191
At least stop there.

19:38.231 --> 19:39.933
We are not going to boil the ocean.

19:39.953 --> 19:42.616
At this point of time, it's too late.

19:42.696 --> 19:45.579
We have been debating on this three months, four months.

19:45.599 --> 19:46.520
We don't have an answer.

19:47.061 --> 19:51.105
Unfortunately, I'm ready to make a decision today if

19:51.085 --> 19:52.848
somebody gave me the option.

19:53.149 --> 19:56.935
Carl will make it today if somebody empowered him, right?

19:57.036 --> 20:02.525
If Brian told Carl, you are 100% accountable for this structure, go put it.

20:02.986 --> 20:09.939
I'm sure he'll come up with the best in class taxonomy and we can say this is the taxonomy I like to it.

20:10.339 --> 20:11.862
But nobody is empowering us.

20:11.842 --> 20:13.465
That's the biggest problem.

20:13.946 --> 20:16.912
Without empowerment, we can be talking, talking, talking.

20:16.932 --> 20:19.898
We might be having the best taxonomy in the world.

20:19.998 --> 20:25.108
We cannot operationalize it because the leaders are not supporting.

20:25.426 --> 20:33.835
I mean, in the end, it's owned by architecture in the end, because they're the ones who have to set this up for the... But please don't say no, I'm not in public.

20:33.855 --> 20:34.496
I understood.

20:35.236 --> 20:39.461
But they do have a setup, and we are having the discussion whether or not we just go with it.

20:39.481 --> 20:44.406
And right now, they don't want to change anything again, because they're going to miss all their dates, because they have to get their stuff in there.

20:44.747 --> 20:52.615
But the reality of it is, what we really need to understand is how this stuff relates to what we're talking about, and how do we explain it to people.

20:52.595 --> 20:55.558
What it is can be debated forever.

20:55.618 --> 20:58.861
If a bunch of leaders want to go argue 50 different times, I don't care.

20:58.881 --> 21:07.310
The reality of it is, is there's a direct mapping between business capabilities and lines and groups and teams.

21:07.490 --> 21:08.691
That's how the two go together.

21:08.711 --> 21:10.213
And they go together for that way for a reason.

21:10.693 --> 21:15.318
There's the reasoning behind this in a lot of cases is when you're dealing with a product model.

21:15.538 --> 21:19.682
For one product doesn't necessarily fit every single type of organization, but

21:19.662 --> 21:29.355
By understanding where the business capabilities are, they do fit every organization, no matter what kind of organization it is, whether it's an infrastructure or a R&D organization, it doesn't matter.

21:30.256 --> 21:35.362
The idea is that what it gives us is a standard methodology for understanding how we're doing.

21:35.543 --> 21:37.185
So you can set metrics.

21:37.205 --> 21:43.152
You can say, am I spending on this capability in the same range as my competition?

21:44.314 --> 21:48.319
Am I delivering time frame wise?

21:48.839 --> 21:51.282
in direct alignment with my competition.

21:51.383 --> 21:59.274
By putting capabilities in it as a rational way and mapping those capabilities in a standard way, it gives us an ability to go against other information that we have.

21:59.814 --> 22:03.640
Now we can do that data and analytics and data driven decision making that makes sense.

22:04.421 --> 22:08.046
If we say we now want to invest in growth,

22:09.427 --> 22:17.217
If we're overspending in five places, but we're underspending on the things that help with growth, we know where we can move things around in a very rational way and make sense.

22:17.838 --> 22:22.784
The idea behind the business capability model is that ability to attach ourselves to something.

22:22.924 --> 22:32.616
If I go to Gartner and say, what is the average that a CPG company of over $5 billion will spend on HR?

22:33.912 --> 22:36.436
it'll give me an idea whether I'm in the ballpark or not.

22:36.456 --> 22:44.811
When we say that we spend too much on things, because we'll hear that quite a bit in a lot of our meetings, people say we're spending too much on, that's where those numbers come from.

22:45.392 --> 22:50.120
But we are currently at such a high level that we know we spend too much on IT.

22:50.621 --> 22:53.085
We don't know we spend too much on what.

22:53.386 --> 23:00.597
So that is a lot of the purpose of why it's there, but we want the product teams to understand is that these capabilities match up to something.

23:01.138 --> 23:07.789
When we're saying that, you know, you need to do these, they're important because they're giving us an actual data driven something.

23:09.331 --> 23:11.615
You know, we don't know whether we're doing good, bad or indifferent.

23:11.635 --> 23:13.538
We only know it from the context of us.

23:15.138 --> 23:25.120
the current leadership, the current and a lot of other things are looking at us and the street will look at us and say, are they doing a good job at a high level?

23:25.481 --> 23:28.187
And that's always been the number, but the next level down matters.

23:29.229 --> 23:33.619
There was the question of, are we spending too much on IT or are we just not making enough money to cover it?

23:35.557 --> 23:36.479
So you have two choices.

23:36.499 --> 23:37.661
You always have two choices.

23:37.681 --> 23:39.083
Do you cut expenses?

23:39.424 --> 24:00.400
I hear you and kind of agree but only my question here is now totally it has to be done that way and then there is a thought but now right now we started with this pioneer and the immediate test please correct me okay this is what it's coming in my mind that

24:00.532 --> 24:02.535
We do have a capability map.

24:02.735 --> 24:10.346
Either we can go with the presentation one or the one which we have pulled it from the Linux tool.

24:11.107 --> 24:15.193
And then we will ask the business to get it, verify and do that.

24:15.353 --> 24:21.983
And another thing is because we might be at L3 or even below that because we could be at the application level.

24:21.963 --> 24:26.470
What could be the different applications are there in that L3?

24:26.951 --> 24:30.336
Maybe it's that something outcome that we look for.

24:30.757 --> 24:32.260
I mean, this is what it's coming for.

24:32.280 --> 24:34.363
It is, but that's being mapped separately right now.

24:34.423 --> 24:38.510
That is a separate exercise that's been going on fairly actively right now.

24:38.630 --> 24:43.618
I'm actually meeting with, you know, Brian's going to have a communication going out on the application list shortly.

24:44.780 --> 24:46.823
Products and applications do not equal.

24:47.090 --> 24:52.357
So you could have three applications in a product or you could have one application in a product.

24:52.417 --> 24:53.118
It doesn't matter.

24:53.178 --> 24:56.743
I mean, like if your workday you may say is, okay, HR core is all in workday.

24:56.763 --> 24:57.784
So I have one application.

24:58.185 --> 24:58.986
Good.

24:59.006 --> 24:59.286
Fine.

24:59.306 --> 25:04.813
If you looked at total rewards, total rewards had a dozen applications underneath it.

25:04.833 --> 25:07.997
And it, but they were all vendor managed, but they had a bunch of applications underneath them.

25:08.438 --> 25:10.401
So they're all, but they're all the same product.

25:10.501 --> 25:12.203
They're just different things.

25:12.672 --> 25:15.656
So, you know, it was the CCR one stream conversation.

25:15.796 --> 25:19.421
If a mitt was the one running CCR, it should be CCR.

25:19.741 --> 25:23.666
If a mitt's only running one stream, is one stream the only thing and is there somebody above him?

25:24.127 --> 25:29.353
Now, if there isn't, then maybe they have two different, you know, L3s and that's what they have.

25:29.453 --> 25:33.478
One is one stream, which we would probably call by its name, not by its product name.

25:34.540 --> 25:37.043
You know, the software product name.

25:37.023 --> 25:41.307
There's lots of different ways to look at these things, but we are currently working on the application list.

25:41.327 --> 25:45.730
That's something else that's being done, and it's being done as AMP because Brian said it should be done as AMP.

25:45.750 --> 25:50.895
Shanti has got something.

25:50.915 --> 25:52.716
We have 12 minutes left.

25:53.237 --> 25:58.501
So my question is, what was the outcome you wanted to achieve on this call?

25:58.842 --> 26:01.244
Because I see outcome for vision session.

26:01.724 --> 26:03.866
What's the vision session?

26:04.126 --> 26:06.388
Who are coming?

26:06.368 --> 26:09.692
Unless there's any other questions specifically to this thing.

26:10.032 --> 26:11.394
Again, this is an informational thing.

26:11.434 --> 26:16.539
If you go with the slide that Chris gave us, it's going to be less hassle, less argument, and it does not going to make really a difference anyway.

26:16.579 --> 26:17.580
So I would just go with that.

26:18.181 --> 26:22.225
But I'm sure we're going to change something, but that's OK.

26:22.265 --> 26:22.846
It doesn't matter.

26:22.906 --> 26:25.009
I mean, like you should go with what Chris's is.

26:25.309 --> 26:30.595
What you really want to know is if they own a function here, no matter what it's called, if we called it 1.1.1, who cares?

26:32.036 --> 26:33.658
What applications they have underneath that?

26:34.465 --> 26:40.674
And if they can say that there's applications under that and we can identify a TPO, that's a positive thing because most of our TPO's are wrong in all of our data.

26:41.214 --> 26:44.599
So that's a huge step forward, so I would go with it.

26:45.240 --> 26:49.165
But is there anything else anybody need to know about what the point of capabilities is?

26:52.750 --> 26:54.853
So Carl, yeah, we shall go ahead.

26:55.954 --> 27:03.645
So the intent of the session was we wanted to try and understand how to incorporate lean IX into

27:04.267 --> 27:06.773
the conversation that we're having with limbs tomorrow.

27:07.254 --> 27:16.197
So we have a draft deck that we've created and Prashanti, I'm sharing information and you can opine on what you want us to do with it.

27:16.598 --> 27:20.267
So first question is, when we meet with some kids tomorrow,

27:21.175 --> 27:31.911
We're going to go over the full value mapping, which is the two slides that I think you guys- Can I see the content, please?

27:31.931 --> 27:33.774
I don't want to be assuming.

27:34.215 --> 27:35.436
I want to see the content.

27:35.456 --> 27:38.822
I want to know who is because I don't see anything on my calendar.

27:39.062 --> 27:41.185
So I'm not sure why I'm not invited.

27:42.507 --> 27:49.157
So I want to be there to understand what's going on in the sessions because I don't want another escalation from Sanket.

27:49.863 --> 27:50.364
Correct, correct.

27:50.384 --> 27:57.032
So this is me and Anuj are tagged in, so Rajini, can you forward the session?

27:57.593 --> 28:00.857
So this is the product vision session, right?

28:00.877 --> 28:08.526
So the first thing that we go over is this, I want Temi and Sanke to first understand the full end-to-end picture.

28:08.967 --> 28:12.331
So we're going to go through this slide and this slide, right?

28:12.551 --> 28:14.794
Okay, just one feedback, right there.

28:14.934 --> 28:16.376
Go back to that slide.

28:16.957 --> 28:17.237
Yep.

28:17.437 --> 28:20.764
The first zero needs to have OKRs over there.

28:20.904 --> 28:23.389
Can view OKRs or can you take in data?

28:23.409 --> 28:25.293
I don't want objective and key results.

28:25.734 --> 28:27.558
OKR phrase should come there.

28:28.520 --> 28:30.464
I'll put it in the brackets, whatever.

28:30.484 --> 28:31.887
Can view OKRs?

28:31.907 --> 28:33.991
Is that what you want?

28:34.011 --> 28:36.055
Yeah, can you take in data?

28:36.075 --> 28:38.500
OKRs or whatever.

28:39.813 --> 28:47.302
I want the keyword OKR over there because you have put it in step 2 OKR.

28:47.703 --> 28:51.257
In step 2 you have to put it as product OKRs.

28:51.642 --> 28:55.226
Remember, you all are using language very loosely.

28:55.266 --> 29:02.053
This can have an impact because I sat down with Sarah Yaffe and convinced her, your OKRs are here.

29:02.153 --> 29:03.694
This is our OKRs.

29:03.714 --> 29:06.858
And she was aligned because Sarah Goodman is not convinced.

29:06.878 --> 29:14.546
So you need to be very critical because when you're translating into decks, you're losing the feedback that people have given you.

29:15.246 --> 29:15.427
OK.

29:15.447 --> 29:15.547
Sure.

29:16.027 --> 29:16.688
Yeah.

29:16.708 --> 29:18.730
So this is the high level view.

29:19.705 --> 29:25.494
that is being shared tomorrow, which is the first 10, 15 minutes.

29:25.674 --> 29:33.306
Can you please change that to can view OKR on the left, put objective key results in the brackets.

29:35.569 --> 29:40.637
I'm sorry, I am very picky on those things because I'm facing the front of it.

29:41.979 --> 29:47.788
And you can remove the last key, but yeah, OKR, yeah.

29:49.928 --> 29:51.169
So you'll go through this.

29:51.610 --> 29:59.079
We're first actually trying to talk about this distinction between SPM and the product model.

29:59.099 --> 30:03.003
So I think this slide should be first, but you tell me if you want to cover it afterward.

30:03.043 --> 30:09.952
I think this is the SPM story, which is, hey, this is where you start, and then this is how you go around in the circle.

30:09.992 --> 30:11.934
This is where we come in, right?

30:12.014 --> 30:14.657
This is where we are coming in with our six steps.

30:14.697 --> 30:18.822
And then this is where we tie the execution and the business value on the metrics and KPI.

30:18.802 --> 30:34.009
So it's basically tying that big picture together that's slide number one slide number two is okay now we'll go into the detailed steps not sessions and steps on how to achieve what we talked about in the previous slide and then I know just go through okay here's

30:33.989 --> 30:36.914
We've kept it very light, right?

30:36.934 --> 30:37.976
We've kept it high level.

30:38.437 --> 30:46.450
Here's what vision means, here's what a vision statement should look like and then we'll go into the workshop saying, okay, here's an example that we gave you for Uber.

30:46.851 --> 30:49.956
We want you to put that workshop and then I want you to put it into Jira.

30:50.425 --> 30:53.909
So then we're going to go into the JIRA structure, that same standard structure.

30:53.929 --> 30:55.290
So let me just go through the slides.

30:55.590 --> 30:58.053
I just quickly talked about all this.

30:58.073 --> 31:00.876
So first step is here's the vision.

31:01.056 --> 31:03.758
Two slides on what is the vision, blah, blah, blah.

31:04.379 --> 31:10.866
Next one is you need a vision statement for your product at the product level that has these things captured in it.

31:10.886 --> 31:11.726
Who is it for?

31:11.887 --> 31:13.088
So where is the template?

31:13.288 --> 31:14.429
Where will they capture it?

31:14.750 --> 31:18.293
The template is over here at the bottom, which is in the last.

31:18.313 --> 31:19.234
What's the template there?

31:19.805 --> 31:20.846
put the template next.

31:21.467 --> 31:26.715
So you said you're going to teach them, this is not a template, this is an example.

31:26.755 --> 31:28.437
Where is the template?

31:28.457 --> 31:32.883
So this is what Anuj is saying that, see we are basically asking them to come up with a template.

31:32.903 --> 31:34.285
I'm just cutting to the chair.

31:34.425 --> 31:35.767
I can share a template.

31:36.128 --> 31:38.191
All I am saying is where is the template?

31:38.531 --> 31:40.394
I need that template in the next slide.

31:40.434 --> 31:46.302
If you're asking them to fill a template, they get a template because this was made clear in the last call

31:46.282 --> 31:50.073
It went against the call with Saakeh and Timi.

31:50.093 --> 31:53.684
Timi just said, give me a template for Shanti.

31:53.764 --> 31:55.369
I'll make him fill the template.

31:55.690 --> 31:57.115
And we still are talking.

31:57.135 --> 31:57.897
There's a template.

31:57.917 --> 31:58.659
There's a template.

31:58.679 --> 32:00.063
I don't see the template.

32:00.083 --> 32:00.966
Is this a template?

32:02.195 --> 32:03.237
Is this a movie?

32:03.257 --> 32:04.418
I don't think I have access to it.

32:04.438 --> 32:06.241
You might want to look like a template.

32:06.281 --> 32:08.044
This is not how the template looks.

32:08.064 --> 32:13.673
I'm sorry to say a little bit of executiveness that you have to put over here.

32:13.713 --> 32:16.878
If it is who, what, why, how you're just going to randomly put here.

32:16.898 --> 32:20.003
They can send it in a email.

32:20.624 --> 32:26.673
This is the output of the workshop where I think he's going to do the workshop, which is here's what we're going to go through.

32:26.994 --> 32:27.915
Here are the things that

32:28.098 --> 32:34.789
If you are giving it, there should be either a mural board, there should be a template where they're putting sticky notes.

32:35.169 --> 32:36.692
There needs to be something guys.

32:36.812 --> 32:40.498
If you're saying a working session, how will you let them do what?

32:40.518 --> 32:41.460
Who is the scribe?

32:41.800 --> 32:49.212
Are you going to open a mural board, put four sections and say, hey, drop in your things over there.

32:49.529 --> 32:50.390
This is the one there.

32:50.871 --> 32:55.279
So this is what screen shot there and say, we are going to capture.

32:55.319 --> 32:58.003
They need to be specific steps.

32:58.144 --> 32:59.446
You will give five minutes.

32:59.726 --> 33:01.289
Have you timed your session?

33:01.389 --> 33:02.972
How much time unusual speak?

33:03.413 --> 33:03.994
When will you?

33:04.034 --> 33:05.817
How much time is this entire thing?

33:05.837 --> 33:07.480
We are going to open up a mural board.

33:07.500 --> 33:08.782
You know, this takes time.

33:09.363 --> 33:11.426
People are thinking people are putting.

33:11.446 --> 33:12.769
They might not put anything.

33:13.309 --> 33:13.630
So.

33:13.610 --> 33:24.448
Are you making them do it in the session or are you going to give them one slider template and say, do however you want but put the vision ultimately?

33:24.708 --> 33:25.469
What are you saying?

33:26.471 --> 33:34.164
So in this session, Anuj is planning that in this session we will ask, because we are giving them guidance in the session, we are giving them the Uber example.

33:34.204 --> 33:39.853
The goal is that they will use that example to fill out the template.

33:40.660 --> 33:41.543
That is the intent.

33:41.904 --> 33:43.789
Let me just, I think I have access to it now.

33:43.809 --> 33:44.351
Thank you.

33:45.373 --> 33:48.242
Oh, I think it's still, it's still working, but whatever.

33:48.262 --> 33:50.247
So you are throwing me this mural board.

33:50.308 --> 33:51.210
What will you tell me?

33:51.230 --> 33:51.391
Okay.

33:51.411 --> 33:52.193
I am circuit.

33:52.594 --> 33:53.356
Walk me through it.

33:54.339 --> 33:55.362
What are you asking?

33:56.236 --> 33:57.499
Let's do it right then.

33:57.619 --> 34:00.885
I'm not sure we have this ready.

34:01.366 --> 34:03.571
You don't know how you people are delivering.

34:04.252 --> 34:06.015
You all are scrambling with me.

34:06.456 --> 34:11.266
One of you showing the mural board, one of you showing the appendix slide.

34:11.566 --> 34:12.809
You don't have a game plan.

34:12.829 --> 34:13.350
Sorry.

34:13.330 --> 34:36.402
you don't none of you have a game plan you have no strategy how you're going to go there you have no strategy how will you ask them to okay you're you're doing a session what will be the output you're saying jeera vishal i see a mural board who is doing what by doing the session i'm doing the opening right i'm doing the opening where i'm giving the big picture

34:36.668 --> 34:40.531
and then Anuj is going to walk through the first few slides with the examples.

34:40.592 --> 34:43.334
So my story is I'm going to do the opening.

34:43.574 --> 34:45.516
How much time is this session?

34:45.536 --> 34:46.297
I'm doing 10 minutes.

34:46.337 --> 34:48.499
Anuj is doing 50, a 60-minute session.

34:49.059 --> 34:54.184
Out of the 50 minutes, Anuj is going to take the first 10, 15 minutes to talk.

34:54.544 --> 34:55.945
Hold on, hold on.

34:56.366 --> 34:59.288
10 minutes you are done, you will cover your three slides.

34:59.308 --> 35:04.573
50 minutes he's doing this workshop, but you were talking about mapping.

35:04.593 --> 35:06.675
Where is the mapping part of it?

35:06.655 --> 35:09.201
asking them to map.

35:09.702 --> 35:23.753
So the theory part is so the next 15, 20 minutes, right, which is the first half hour of the session, we're going to cover the theory, right, which is this is how you do it, which 30 minutes over in the next 30 minutes, what is the industry exactly.

35:26.028 --> 35:33.419
session and which is going to give the example so that they can start thinking about, hey, look, let's use the Uber example to talk about this who, what, why, what.

35:33.999 --> 35:41.050
Now apply this to your product, and that's where we are introducing the Miro board, which is over here, which is the workshop agenda.

35:41.450 --> 35:43.433
This is the 30 minute workshop.

35:43.453 --> 35:45.035
Now, when- Where is the mapping?

35:45.316 --> 35:48.981
Where are you asking them to map?

35:50.075 --> 35:51.658
mapping it back into Jira, right?

35:51.678 --> 35:52.460
That's what you're asking.

35:52.480 --> 35:53.963
Is that what you want to know?

35:53.983 --> 35:55.726
You said Jira, that is one thing.

35:55.806 --> 35:59.854
What about we are talking about all these L2T, all these things?

35:59.875 --> 36:01.458
Where is that?

36:01.578 --> 36:05.205
So that is the part that we were trying to understand today.

36:05.225 --> 36:08.151
No, but one number is over, right?

36:08.890 --> 36:13.397
One day, we are not even 24 hours away from the session.

36:13.417 --> 36:15.500
I don't see a skeleton.

36:15.520 --> 36:18.725
I don't see which slide is getting delivered by whom.

36:19.066 --> 36:21.570
I don't see how much time we are reserving for work.

36:21.670 --> 36:23.032
I see something over here.

36:23.052 --> 36:24.755
45 minutes discussion.

36:24.815 --> 36:25.836
I'm synthesized.

36:26.958 --> 36:28.941
Why should they be even doing it?

36:29.157 --> 36:31.700
Along with you, I don't understand these visions.

36:32.040 --> 36:37.607
You're not giving them capabilities to say, hey, map your vision to capabilities.

36:37.627 --> 36:38.468
You are not.

36:38.488 --> 36:45.156
And there was a better slide, a better template of a vision where it had a couple of boxes over there.

36:45.176 --> 36:46.958
What is the purpose of the product?

36:46.978 --> 36:47.999
What is this?

36:48.359 --> 36:51.763
That would automatically give you an end to capability.

36:51.783 --> 36:55.047
Because if a circuit says, what's the purpose of lens,

36:55.027 --> 36:59.575
Even we might be able to map it to L2, but now you're not asking anything.

36:59.655 --> 37:11.416
Just simply putting why, what, when, they're going to give you one line sentences and that will become your vision statement because they are saying, give me a perfect template.

37:11.836 --> 37:13.078
I will fill it over there.

37:13.359 --> 37:17.406
So if you have all these questions, which applications you map to, which

37:17.386 --> 37:23.872
there should be a place in the template which asks for those questions.

37:24.292 --> 37:27.896
If you don't ask for those questions, they're not going to answer your question.

37:28.316 --> 37:28.777
Got it.

37:29.097 --> 37:36.744
So Carl, can you give me that word document that you extracted out of Lean IX where you have the L1, L2, whatever, the other products?

37:37.044 --> 37:44.271
If you can just send me that, I'll create a slide that says at the output of this session, these are the things that we want for links.

37:44.909 --> 37:50.319
No, your template will not even be influenced by what he's giving.

37:50.619 --> 37:53.464
He can give ABCX, YZ, Vishal.

37:53.825 --> 37:55.809
Where is my vision template?

37:55.829 --> 38:09.313
I'm simply asking all of you guys, where is my vision template which says, hey, there needs to be a question for what are the A2 capabilities, your mapping, who is your sponsor, who is your stakeholders, who is your leader.

38:09.293 --> 38:11.476
That's all thing is vision.

38:11.616 --> 38:14.501
You're all so focused on piecemealing it.

38:15.242 --> 38:20.950
Vision is just what the product... No, as a part of the vision, I want to know all these outlying things.

38:20.970 --> 38:22.132
Who is your product owner?

38:22.252 --> 38:23.153
Business owner?

38:23.554 --> 38:25.036
All these things need to be answered.

38:25.056 --> 38:27.439
This is your one shot you're getting with them.

38:28.060 --> 38:31.826
In one hour, ask them to fill all the missing information.

38:31.846 --> 38:33.709
You people told me, we don't know teams.

38:33.809 --> 38:34.710
We don't know.

38:34.690 --> 38:36.033
Put all those boxes.

38:36.053 --> 38:44.674
There needs to be a pretty template, like a project charter template, a project, a vision template should be there, which is very prescriptive.

38:44.694 --> 38:46.078
You don't have to narrate it.

38:46.619 --> 38:51.130
Any person should read and be, who is your business partner?

38:51.818 --> 38:53.861
Sake should be just simply able to fill it.

38:53.961 --> 38:57.505
You don't have to teach him who is a business partner, right?

38:57.765 --> 39:02.231
Do you know who the... Sake always keeps saying, hey, I work with my business.

39:02.431 --> 39:03.452
I do whatever he says.

39:03.853 --> 39:06.656
Do we know who that person is referring to?

39:07.177 --> 39:09.881
Does it take requirements from 10 people, one person?

39:10.581 --> 39:11.903
Do we know that?

39:13.047 --> 39:16.636
If you know it, pre-populate it.

39:17.679 --> 39:26.061
If you're saying that you want a template for all six of this, we can just create that and share it with them tomorrow.

39:27.408 --> 39:28.129
We can do that.

39:28.149 --> 39:34.500
We can give them saying, here's a template for vision, here's a template for product.

39:35.242 --> 39:37.786
We have been talking about this for three months now.

39:38.347 --> 39:42.194
And what Anuj promised me was for every workshop there's a template.

39:42.214 --> 39:43.476
And I don't see a template.

39:43.496 --> 39:44.117
I'm sorry.

39:44.177 --> 39:45.159
I'm losing it.

39:45.880 --> 39:49.987
Either you tell me, Vishanti, you do it, create a template.

39:50.007 --> 39:51.370
I'll come and create the template.

39:51.390 --> 39:52.251
I'll deliver the template.

39:53.378 --> 39:59.348
But I'm not saying we're always talking, hey, this could be one way, that could be one way.

39:59.508 --> 40:07.862
Some one way we need, whether we like the template or not, whoever is asking the questions, you need to put that question there so that we get the answers.

40:08.323 --> 40:11.168
At the end of the day, I'm really afraid, guys.

40:11.148 --> 40:13.411
We will just get four sentences.

40:13.992 --> 40:14.713
What is this?

40:14.733 --> 40:18.299
He'll say, it's a lab management system that will be answered.

40:18.399 --> 40:19.681
I know circuits very well.

40:21.023 --> 40:23.827
Then he will say, hey, why do we need it?

40:23.987 --> 40:25.830
He'll say, it's a GHP thing.

40:25.970 --> 40:26.290
I know.

40:26.551 --> 40:27.933
It's a TQ process.

40:27.993 --> 40:29.095
We cannot miss it.

40:29.155 --> 40:31.538
He's going to give crappy answers, believe me.

40:32.780 --> 40:34.062
Then you will say, I don't know.

40:34.142 --> 40:34.843
Why what?

40:34.983 --> 40:35.264
Who?

40:35.324 --> 40:35.765
I don't know.

40:36.125 --> 40:38.809
He'll just give you one line sentences.

40:38.789 --> 40:43.014
And he'll challenge you, this is what is the template I have answered your questions.

40:43.154 --> 40:44.476
Rajini, you know him better.

40:44.516 --> 40:48.981
You go with those four answers, you're going to get four sentences.

40:51.604 --> 40:55.368
And he's only started, that's why I want to know the participants, who is there?

40:55.729 --> 41:01.135
Even if you open a mural board, there will be one, one sticky that he'll place it.

41:02.735 --> 41:03.678
Who all are coming?

41:03.698 --> 41:04.501
Is Timmy coming?

41:04.521 --> 41:05.925
Is Smith coming?

41:06.086 --> 41:08.052
Who are the best partners?

41:08.072 --> 41:09.236
The best three people.

41:09.256 --> 41:10.299
He told only three are enough.

41:10.460 --> 41:12.205
Timmy, Smith and himself.

41:13.906 --> 41:18.190
So only three people are coming and I asked him, like, do you want to, you know, forward the invite to anybody?

41:18.210 --> 41:20.112
So Chris Smith will laugh at this template.

41:20.152 --> 41:22.154
If you say, why, what, it's full.

41:22.534 --> 41:25.417
He'll say, he's just, then he's going to challenge me.

41:25.457 --> 41:29.441
Hold on, hold on, Rajini.

41:29.861 --> 41:35.106
Now the conversation I know once, because Timney yesterday you, you heard Rajini, you were there, right?

41:35.207 --> 41:37.389
Well, he said, Prashanti, give me a template.

41:37.569 --> 41:38.470
I'll populate it.

41:38.530 --> 41:40.892
Then my, will my maturity go up?

41:41.851 --> 41:43.053
That was his question.

41:43.293 --> 41:46.357
I say your maturity won't go up, but we'll give you a template.

41:46.738 --> 41:48.040
And this is not a template.

41:50.743 --> 41:52.506
Who can come back to me with a template?

41:52.666 --> 41:56.311
If I don't get a template, at what time is the session?

41:56.371 --> 41:57.453
Tomorrow noon.

41:58.054 --> 41:59.356
Tomorrow at noon.

42:01.699 --> 42:04.743
But we'll actually have the invite.

42:06.245 --> 42:09.630
But what we'll do is, today I think we need to have

42:10.741 --> 42:13.987
I think I understand where you are going with this question.

42:14.007 --> 42:16.091
I think everybody understands where you're going with this, right?

42:16.111 --> 42:19.938
Which is, if I get one hour with you, I'm going to give you everything that I need.

42:20.298 --> 42:22.783
I can tell you what the CanVue target and OKR is.

42:23.504 --> 42:25.688
I need your product line vision.

42:25.969 --> 42:31.078
I need your product group OKRs, product OKRs for Lin specifically.

42:31.058 --> 42:34.141
And we'll give them like one or two slides, one slide.

42:34.281 --> 42:37.364
And one more question is, we need Chris Serito there.

42:37.724 --> 42:41.868
If we are talking about Lee and IH and all, why is Chris missing?

42:42.368 --> 42:43.669
Why is Ruchir missing?

42:43.769 --> 42:49.895
Or at least Ruchir should have been there as Chris's delegate, right?

42:50.075 --> 42:52.718
He is going to support you on those product vision.

42:52.738 --> 42:59.564
Whatever, if Chris says, hey, this is not the L2 capabilities, Ruchir has to support you and say, this is the L2 capabilities.

42:59.604 --> 43:01.065
Why is he missing?

43:01.045 --> 43:02.768
These are the people.

43:02.788 --> 43:04.431
You need to think about the audience.

43:04.672 --> 43:08.579
As we are changing the scope, we need to get the right audience there.

43:08.679 --> 43:11.665
If Chris cannot be there, who is the next best person?

43:11.705 --> 43:12.066
Ruchit.

43:12.386 --> 43:16.093
If Ruchit cannot be there, we still make them optional and go forwards.

43:16.454 --> 43:21.383
Because unless we bring Chris and Chris Smith, Chris Serito and Chris Smith,

43:21.363 --> 43:23.306
They will never come into an alignment.

43:23.346 --> 43:30.395
We need to bring them, do a face-off and say, hey, you people fight it out and tell me, come out of this session with one.

43:31.076 --> 43:32.638
That's our victory, right?

43:32.698 --> 43:34.480
Because we are running with two things.

43:35.041 --> 43:37.144
Make them meet and talk in that session.

43:37.184 --> 43:38.886
They might quarrel.

43:39.006 --> 43:39.527
It's okay.

43:40.068 --> 43:41.350
Mediate that discussion.

43:41.650 --> 43:49.300
And when you come out of that discussion, we should have one list or aligned list where we know Chris Smith and Chris Cerrito agrees.

43:49.420 --> 43:50.762
That is a victory.

43:50.742 --> 43:54.827
I want to define what is success of our thing.

43:54.847 --> 44:03.977
We can just give this course and come out and we can be again talking about there are two lists or any of the problem and say there is one list right now.

44:04.158 --> 44:07.121
Because what does Brian Radisab is going to go and do?

44:07.221 --> 44:09.704
He'll have a separate conversation with Chris Serito.

44:09.724 --> 44:10.665
He'll have a separate one.

44:10.946 --> 44:11.326
No.

44:12.167 --> 44:13.609
Now rubber hits the road.

44:14.209 --> 44:16.692
Why are we catching a capability list to the vision?

44:17.133 --> 44:19.095
Why are we not trying to get the vision right?

44:20.324 --> 44:22.388
We're not.

44:24.272 --> 44:31.606
The goal was to try and get as much as possible in one session instead of having multiple sessions, but we don't have to.

44:31.847 --> 44:38.400
I understand that, but I don't think that we're ready to go and say which one of these things do you map up to if this stuff is still being debated and being reviewed.

44:40.000 --> 44:43.786
But I heard there was already an alignment.

44:43.806 --> 44:45.929
That's how it went into linearity.

44:45.949 --> 44:50.496
So I just want to remind Chris Matt, this is already aligned and accepted.

44:50.516 --> 44:52.299
So why are you changing the structure?

44:52.780 --> 44:55.143
I want a second objective to come up.

44:55.163 --> 44:57.086
We have all the right people in the room.

44:57.167 --> 45:01.333
Why are we hesitating to ask the right questions?

45:01.313 --> 45:05.241
Because we know it's a lingering problem, can we fix the lingering issue?

45:05.962 --> 45:09.810
You're trying to fix Chris Cerudo's problem with the product model.

45:10.291 --> 45:15.482
And by doing that, you're going to have an issue, I mean, you need them to have a vision statement.

45:15.762 --> 45:19.069
The success for the product model is they have the vision statement.

45:19.049 --> 45:29.086
How can a vision statement be drafted without knowing what capability they are supporting?

45:29.106 --> 45:30.609
Because that's the purpose, right?

45:31.050 --> 45:35.978
In reality, they should be able to say, I am going to support this

45:35.958 --> 45:39.523
Well, yes and no.

45:39.543 --> 45:41.085
We've already made the decision.

45:41.265 --> 45:44.330
If we made the decision to go from the bottom up, it doesn't matter nearly as much.

45:44.510 --> 45:45.711
They know what they're targeting.

45:46.272 --> 45:55.685
If you're going to say that the vision statement is going to be done the right way, then we would have started with L1s and we would have gotten them to give us one that would have been used for L2s.

45:55.725 --> 45:56.827
It would have been used for L3s.

45:57.147 --> 45:58.309
We're starting at L3s.

45:58.729 --> 46:03.636
So what we really have is the success is that they come out with a vision statement.

46:05.185 --> 46:11.671
Sorry, I have to go, but you guys know brainstorm it, but I need a template.

46:12.012 --> 46:14.334
I need a format, how we are going through.

46:14.854 --> 46:19.419
I'm going to do some offline conversation.

46:19.519 --> 46:22.602
I'm trying to bring Chris Smith and Chris Ferrito together.

46:22.642 --> 46:28.728
Whether in that call or a separate, let me get back to you how that goes.

46:28.748 --> 46:30.670
For now, I need to know.

46:30.650 --> 46:33.633
In respect, forget which capability metrics.

46:33.653 --> 46:39.880
At least we all agree that a product should support a capability.

46:39.900 --> 46:44.606
Wherever it is, however it is, they should support some R&D capability.

46:45.186 --> 46:51.413
As long as they can articulate that in their own words, then we can match that capability in our taxonomy.

46:51.434 --> 46:57.180
But they need to be able to say, this product delivers some capability.

46:57.160 --> 47:05.463
If that can be there in that vision template, that is what I'm looking towards.

47:05.744 --> 47:08.130
And then we will see how to map that.

47:08.150 --> 47:11.760
But they need to say which business capable.
