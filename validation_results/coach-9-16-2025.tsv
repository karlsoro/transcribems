3642	25752	maybe let's give one more minute for Vishal to join in then he gets started so today we wanted to talk about okay it is Satish who has joined okay
26356	39218	We wanted to talk about the taxonomy and after that we also wanted to touch upon what are the outcomes that we are planning to achieve.
39687	41269	by end of the vision statement.
41829	42670	There was a discussion.
42730	44813	There's a thought Prashanti has shared that with us.
44833	46154	She's looking for three things.
46194	53703	One is the vision statement, then L2, L3 capabilities and the mapping to the respective application.
53943	55105	So that's the three things.
55185	62353	But then here is the first step like building that the standing and modifying the content for the vision workshop tomorrow.
62333	63095	accordingly.
63375	65099	That's the plan.
65119	69189	So Kaal, I think we have full house, Anuj may not be able to join.
69249	70793	He has some medical emergency.
71334	72276	That's what he shared.
72396	75263	So we can get started.
75597	76419	over to you.
76439	77220	We are all yours.
77420	77721	Sure.
78282	78523	Sure.
78543	84935	I mean, and a lot of what we were covering was, I mean, it seems to be that there's people don't know what a business capability is or how business capability maps are.
85336	89944	I'm not looking at what our business capability map is, because there's still some stuff up in the air there.
90065	94433	We had some conversation over the last couple of days of
95830	106402	There is a version in Lean IX, which currently is considered the Kenview version, but there's also some discussion about whether or not the Lean IX version is right or not, so we'll continue to have those discussions.
107123	112509	But my bigger thing is understanding what a business capability map and how it works into the product model.
112569	115372	What does a business capability map have to do with a product model?
116133	118796	They are very, very much linked.
119417	124302	And by definition, if you look at the design of a product model by anybody
125243	128306	Actually, I was just looking yesterday at seven different product models.
128666	129587	There's seven different versions.
129627	133831	The product model that I've been able to locate, of the seven, every single one of them uses.
133891	141677	Sorry, I just got some, the bing that you have to pay attention to.
142418	150685	In the product model, what they're doing in a lot of cases is what you're doing exactly what we're looking at.
150805	153748	When you talk about a line to a group,
154167	155469	to a team.
156470	158093	You're looking at capabilities.
158493	161598	A line is a high level, a level one capability.
161678	166445	A product group is a level two capability and a level three capability is a team.
167025	168648	That's why they're defined the way they are.
169669	172293	We had a definition that was used to category software.
172754	174156	We're changing from that definition.
174276	175357	We're moving out of that definition.
175377	177741	There's a copa version that was used there.
178161	180765	Copa is a standards organization.
180745	185012	the standards organization of the CPG business is what it's from.
185893	186714	We won't be using that one.
186815	188057	There are some changes from there.
189319	192283	There's a couple other models that are out there that are fairly common.
192844	199234	About five of them use the same model, but for the most part there's different models.
199675	207968	So I'm intentionally going to use a graphic from, and I will share in a second as soon as I find it,
208133	210656	A graphic that's... this is how it looks.
210676	211617	This isn't ours.
212418	213599	It has nothing to do with ours.
213759	221168	I don't want to use ours for a very good reason, is that ours is up in the air and I don't want people to get confused by what's going to be there.
222910	225453	So, if I can just find this stupid thing.
226654	228176	I will share it.
230679	231459	Alright, where did it go?
231500	236205	That's not the one.
236685	238107	That is ours, okay.
238610	247360	And I am working currently on, as part of another process, I'm working on what ours will look like somewhat.
247500	256190	I need to get agreement from a couple of people before I can say so, because whether we're gonna have one or two and things like that, because there's a lot of different thought processes out there.
256590	259433	So, where did it go?
260274	260955	There it is, okay.
262116	263138	Now I have to go back to sharing.
263758	265360	I had to find it before I could share it.
267888	287287	The fun of working on a Mac is you have multiple screens, and I can't find the stupid thing on the screen I want it to be on.
288508	290530	Alright, I'll open it again.
290550	292692	I can't show it.
292712	294013	Alright, let me try this.
294331	296858	if I share my entire thing just because it's easier that way.
298723	301972	And then you can tell me whether or not you can see it when I get it.
302213	303657	Where'd it go?
303677	303918	All right.
303998	305101	If I share my screen, can you see that?
305462	306966	Are you seeing a big box?
306986	307748	Okay.
308390	308932	Cool.
308952	309253	All right.
309373	310095	Now.
310312	313719	When I talk about L1s, then this is where you'll start to see where things happen.
313739	320151	When you talk about L1s, where you see operating processes here or management and support processes, those are L1s.
320532	329449	Those usually have a VP over them at a VP level that would be responsible for operating processes and what the goals are for that operating processes group.
330210	332134	So if we were to look at
332435	333897	probably Eleanor is the best mix.
334058	344614	Eleanor and our company has enterprise services, which includes corporate services and it includes supply chain, which is sometimes done, sometimes not.
344674	345776	It's a little unique on its own.
346958	353228	But what comes in after that normally would then be where do you take the things that are inside of?
353596	354438	enterprise services.
354478	356383	So enterprise services has a lot of different systems.
357105	359692	Okay, we have a lot of different things, but they're grouped together.
359772	362559	So maybe we were to say is I'm going to do corporate systems.
364384	367692	Now the thing that gets lost quite often is you can have multiple capabilities under there.
367732	370339	So you might say corporate systems is one of these boxes.
372057	373380	Well, what do we have in corporate systems?
374102	375566	Well, we can have finance systems.
375626	376769	We can have HR systems.
376829	378213	But what is the capability?
378273	379015	What are they doing?
379596	387957	So if I were to look at HR and say, what are the actual capabilities that would make up these blue boxes in this case?
387937	393164	I would look at things like if I said I was in corporate systems and I had capabilities inside corporate systems.
393204	396908	Now HR can be grouped in there as its own or as something different.
397008	398670	You could make HR one of these boxes.
399672	400553	People do it different ways.
400813	404978	So if we were to say HR was one of these yellow blocks, HR has capabilities.
405239	408142	You have core HCM, which is things like workday.
408983	412808	You have compensations, which could be in total reward.
414670	416813	You could have
418885	422454	talent recruiting, which is another part of all of that.
422875	427987	Now those would normally have a leader in the yellow box, in that case it would be Jessica in our case because we've dealt with Jessica.
428308	431275	And the blue box is what you would see is the
431491	433795	folks that we're working with, and I can't remember what her name is.
434215	435598	Generally, it would actually be somebody more.
435758	438803	Now, we have an extra layer in the corporate end of the world.
439204	440606	So we do have extra people in there.
441227	444913	But if we were to split off HR on its own, we wouldn't.
444953	448058	If we said HR and compensation is that, then you'd have just owning two boxes.
448679	449881	That's why it gets confused.
450322	457954	But what we're trying to do is say is, what I need to know is, what are my high level lines so that I have a leader here that's
458373	461317	aligning with that business side of that.
461337	463601	These don't just apply to technology.
463641	465083	They apply to technology and business.
465964	477400	So if I were to be able to apply both of them and say, okay, in the business, we have a set of goals, those goals come cascading down when we talk about cost savings.
477801	481326	Maybe at operating process, we want to save
483095	487242	50 million dollars and we have six boxes here.
487763	499404	We may split that six boxes into six parts and say you each have to do one or we may do it unevenly because of the impact each group has.
499464	501408	That would be where that cascaded goal would come from.
501488	506757	So the vision of operating processes is to shorten work times and reduce costs.
507462	509324	Okay, that vision is gonna cascade down.
509804	518171	It's gonna cascade down to the things, what impact they can have, then those will get down to the team level to say which individual team should be supporting in what level.
518632	520093	So the goal doesn't change.
520914	525117	The portion of the goal that the teams can actually impact changes.
526859	528460	So that's when you're looking at your vision.
528500	529661	The vision doesn't change.
529762	534025	The vision becomes specified much more detailed to what you can do.
534946	537148	So if they said, yeah, go ahead.
538006	540328	question for you.
540348	549836	Can we say that this is a guideline for teams to define what their L1 capabilities are?
551658	558024	Well, L1 is a product line.
558864	562928	Teams wouldn't define what their product line is.
563648	567692	Corporate systems, if you were going into who's going first?
568465	569886	Who's going tomorrow?
571828	588304	Okay, so you may be looking at, you know, research and development as being the product line, which is probably, may or may not be part of operations, but that's okay.
588324	596532	So let's assume that R&D was this thing, rather than operating processes, this said research and development, and you were going into the lab services.
597440	601007	There could be two teams, there could be three teams, there could be multiple software packages.
601508	611148	So their L1 would then be R&D, their L2 would be lab services, and their individual teams, limbs being one of them, would be an L3.
611269	618283	So then the level three capability is lab, I forget what limbs does now, lab monitoring and notebooking.
619343	627551	So how do I translate this into business capabilities that I'm trying to like I'm maybe just as me.
627571	633076	Well, yeah, again, it's this is where we run into a problem here at Kenview because we haven't really settled on something.
633096	638361	There are industry definitions that say this is the capabilities that you do in the company.
639081	643105	We can use those or we can use what they define if they want to call limbs.
644066	646228	I am the lab management platforms.
646698	647039	Okay.
647239	648281	Your lab management platforms.
648301	649403	Do you have any more than one system?
649623	650024	Maybe not.
650485	651427	It's possible they don't.
652128	654032	It could be their lab management platforms.
654072	656376	Then their blue box would say lab management platforms.
658941	660003	Which is fine.
660063	663148	I mean, they can define whatever they want to put there.
663389	670562	The problem I think we have right now is that we have multiple places where we've already gathered this information multiple times.
670863	672265	and everybody's getting different answers.
672967	677334	So we have to figure out who is the source of truth or what is the source of truth and stick to one.
677955	681301	So right now what I'm using is what actually happens to be in Lean IX.
682283	688153	So if I were to look at what's in Lean IX, Lean IX has a set of things.
688193	688975	Let me see if I can find it.
689135	690998	I probably can because I think I had it open.
691957	697014	I think she just stepped out as well.
697174	704177	What I understood here is the L1 is kind of equivalent to the product line.
704798	709582	That's what we are seeing it, which particularly talks about what your product does.
710463	711984	Not product, product line does.
712144	713626	That's what in combination.
714146	714947	That's what it is.
715087	717749	And then we have not tested upon L2 and L3.
717789	720572	But who defined these L1, L2, L3?
720612	724375	Who are the responsible person who has to define these?
725956	728639	Well, right now what we have is, I don't even actually know.
728739	733523	I mean, architecture worked with a bunch of senior leaders to come up with a number of definitions.
734802	739208	So that is who defined the ones that we have.
739228	741891	So can you see a business capability index I have for Lean IX here?
744094	745936	I can see the screen.
746297	755289	Okay, so if I look at this, now if I look at the L ones that they have defined, you would look at this and say, okay, here, my product line is R&D and engineer.
757972	758873	Makes sense, right?
759033	760275	It's a rational thing, because it's there.
760315	761417	Those are already defined.
762278	764100	Normally there's eight, we have 33.
765903	770189	Then if I came down again a little level down to L2s, now I would see is okay.
770209	771051	Well, there's a bunch of them.
771111	772272	So wait, this is limb.
772292	775517	So this is going to be, you know, 21 too.
775657	778802	So it was the R&D in engineering and lab management.
779002	782628	Now, if I want to get to level three, cause they have an additional level here.
782648	787515	And theoretically this is an additional level because they're, they missed them.
787535	792923	Oh, but let's, then I come down to 21.
795822	801430	Now they could be limbs itself could be one of these lab management data.
801491	804275	So maybe they're 2123 lab data management.
807119	812828	And they're different than whoever is doing lab data visualization or real material management or any of the other management.
813549	818857	So assuming that these are the correct ones because these are the ones that are set up currently in lean IX.
819478	821521	And they're pretty adamant about keeping them that way.
821561	822943	They're not going to change them at this point.
823565	825627	So just one question, Karl.
826348	829972	I think, at least let's take the example of R&D.
831614	838803	I'm not sure if you have access, maybe we can look at it, download and see what Linaix has.
839363	847352	But my understanding is Chris Smith has already defined his L1, L2, L3 capabilities.
848093	850416	And based on what I'm hearing,
851510	854134	I mean, there's nobody else deciding these things.
854154	856998	It's us or it's them, right?
857098	864048	We have not taken a stab and said, Brian has not told us saying that we'll go with the industry best practices.
864269	866892	Somebody at his level has to make a decision.
867053	869556	This is the Lean IX data that we're looking at right now.
869576	871219	This is not industry best practices.
871699	874243	This specifically is Lean IX.
874564	876807	Okay, let me see what I have.
877428	880993	I have what Chris gave me was one second.
883117	888327	He has given, if you don't mind I'll steal the chair for one second and I'll give it back to you.
888968	889749	Okay.
889769	893075	This is what he has given me unless it has changed.
893115	898425	I don't know what's the latest, but this is what he's saying is art is.
899266	902270	These are his L2 capabilities, these are the L3.
902671	910102	So according to him, these are the product, no, I think this is product line, product groups and products.
910403	911925	This is how they are looking at it.
912306	918675	And then maybe LIMS falls under regulatory, I don't know, regulatory or clinical, I'm not sure.
918655	921960	But this is what I was expecting to see in Linux.
922380	928509	If this is not matching, then we need... And that will never end up in Linux because those aren't actual categories.
928549	934097	Those are actually... Medical safety is not a category because it could fit in 50 different places.
935760	937723	It's not going to show up in capabilities.
937783	943431	Now, what Chris has here, my understanding is he got this agreed upon with senior leaders.
944288	945330	we're following up.
945370	946492	I had a conversation with Brian on it.
946512	948455	We're having some follow-up with it on it already.
948516	955528	But the idea was, do we adapt to what Lean IX is saying, or do we let every single group do it the way they want to do it?
955608	962781	Because the problem that we have, and I think it's a little off track of the conversation we're having here, because we can let them tell us anything they want.
963222	965706	We have to make a decision on what
965686	966828	chart we're going to use.
967188	969331	There's a hundred charts out there.
969352	971314	Unfortunately, I'm stopping my share.
971695	974700	If you give me that list, I'm going to take both of them.
974740	982571	I'm going to send it to Chris Smith and Chris Cerito, coffee, Brian, you and Sarah, and say, pick one.
982591	983493	We are moving forward.
983513	985295	Yeah, and Brian and Sarah already have this.
985356	988701	Because unfortunately, I am not getting that empowerment.
988721	990023	Okay, it's already on Brian's desk.
990063	990904	Brian already has it.
990924	992727	He's had it for a few days and he's going through it.
992847	993668	So
993648	996712	You can check on his status with it and let's go that way.
996832	1003181	Can you just give me the two letters R and D and then shall both of them R and D?
1003201	1004143	But it's actually not that.
1004163	1006846	What I'm trying to do is explain why we do it the way we do it.
1007167	1008469	What chart we use doesn't matter.
1008569	1010591	And I don't want to go too far off of what chart.
1011032	1012995	We know there's questions of which chart we're going to use.
1013075	1015318	I don't want to get stuck in that.
1015585	1019192	The idea is we keep talking about business capabilities.
1019653	1026427	For us, if we ask people to map to some capabilities, we have to give them capabilities to say map it, right?
1026808	1029533	Now, which capability will put in front of them?
1029553	1031417	We try to put whatever is at risk.
1031397	1052595	aligned and then if they want to throw some dots evolve that that's up to them but at this point of time the direction I've got is don't disrupt anything if there's something already existing just go with it that's the strong direction I have received but but I might be wrong there might be something else that's going on right now
1052575	1057905	This team is looking for cardless, not like, hey, maybe this or that.
1058025	1061732	We need to go with one list so that they can finish the activity of mapping.
1061752	1067483	Because if we put two lists in front of Rajini and say, hey, ask them, they can map here.
1067583	1068385	This is better.
1068405	1070549	This is Chris says, you can map here.
1070609	1072092	This is what Chris Smith says.
1072533	1074035	It will be very confusing to them.
1074055	1075478	We need to give them one list.
1075458	1078026	Let Chris Smith and Chris said it or fight it out.
1078668	1083544	One list comes out of it and that list goes to this training as simple as that.
1084402	1086966	And Prishanthi, I have a follow up question on that.
1086986	1091272	So you have shared that, you know, that slide that we have it from long, right?
1091933	1093536	It talks about L2L3.
1093916	1100466	So when we are in a workshop, are we asking the business to verify it, whether this is correct or not?
1100786	1103450	Because it's the audience.
1103631	1107436	Whoever we have invited, I'm assuming they are the decision makers over there.
1107877	1109579	It could be the technical leader.
1109599	1111202	It could be the business.
1111342	1112704	It's a collaborative thing.
1112684	1120354	If they are saying, hey, this application, hey, there is this, whatever, ana plan, this is the demand planning.
1120754	1125500	Yes, the technical person is saying this, does the business person agree?
1126001	1127583	Are his capabilities delivered?
1127803	1130807	Do they use ana plan for supply planning?
1130847	1131949	That's the biggest question.
1132229	1136194	If yes, yes, yes, that's the application.
1136596	1139701	That's the capability, that's how you manage it.
1139721	1144428	And then we might be just talking about one product here because we are just talking pioneers.
1144809	1150257	But ideally, like Karli is saying, we should do top-down, but we are not in that space.
1150277	1151439	We are doing bottom-up.
1151780	1161675	So maybe in that entire hierarchy, it's only one box you're going to pick up and say, hey, these two applications, we have been talking about maps to the supply plan.
1161993	1162413	That's it.
1163034	1164456	You mapped it, done.
1165076	1167459	Then you say, okay, the product, whatever.
1168380	1172845	Finalize the name, finalize the L2 capability, finalize the applications.
1172965	1176269	That's your two-way mapping, right?
1177110	1178191	At least stop there.
1178231	1179933	We are not going to boil the ocean.
1179953	1182616	At this point of time, it's too late.
1182696	1185579	We have been debating on this three months, four months.
1185599	1186520	We don't have an answer.
1187061	1191105	Unfortunately, I'm ready to make a decision today if
1191085	1192848	somebody gave me the option.
1193149	1196935	Carl will make it today if somebody empowered him, right?
1197036	1202525	If Brian told Carl, you are 100% accountable for this structure, go put it.
1202986	1209939	I'm sure he'll come up with the best in class taxonomy and we can say this is the taxonomy I like to it.
1210339	1211862	But nobody is empowering us.
1211842	1213465	That's the biggest problem.
1213946	1216912	Without empowerment, we can be talking, talking, talking.
1216932	1219898	We might be having the best taxonomy in the world.
1219998	1225108	We cannot operationalize it because the leaders are not supporting.
1225426	1233835	I mean, in the end, it's owned by architecture in the end, because they're the ones who have to set this up for the... But please don't say no, I'm not in public.
1233855	1234496	I understood.
1235236	1239461	But they do have a setup, and we are having the discussion whether or not we just go with it.
1239481	1244406	And right now, they don't want to change anything again, because they're going to miss all their dates, because they have to get their stuff in there.
1244747	1252615	But the reality of it is, what we really need to understand is how this stuff relates to what we're talking about, and how do we explain it to people.
1252595	1255558	What it is can be debated forever.
1255618	1258861	If a bunch of leaders want to go argue 50 different times, I don't care.
1258881	1267310	The reality of it is, is there's a direct mapping between business capabilities and lines and groups and teams.
1267490	1268691	That's how the two go together.
1268711	1270213	And they go together for that way for a reason.
1270693	1275318	There's the reasoning behind this in a lot of cases is when you're dealing with a product model.
1275538	1279682	For one product doesn't necessarily fit every single type of organization, but
1279662	1289355	By understanding where the business capabilities are, they do fit every organization, no matter what kind of organization it is, whether it's an infrastructure or a R&D organization, it doesn't matter.
1290256	1295362	The idea is that what it gives us is a standard methodology for understanding how we're doing.
1295543	1297185	So you can set metrics.
1297205	1303152	You can say, am I spending on this capability in the same range as my competition?
1304314	1308319	Am I delivering time frame wise?
1308839	1311282	in direct alignment with my competition.
1311383	1319274	By putting capabilities in it as a rational way and mapping those capabilities in a standard way, it gives us an ability to go against other information that we have.
1319814	1323640	Now we can do that data and analytics and data driven decision making that makes sense.
1324421	1328046	If we say we now want to invest in growth,
1329427	1337217	If we're overspending in five places, but we're underspending on the things that help with growth, we know where we can move things around in a very rational way and make sense.
1337838	1342784	The idea behind the business capability model is that ability to attach ourselves to something.
1342924	1352616	If I go to Gartner and say, what is the average that a CPG company of over $5 billion will spend on HR?
1353912	1356436	it'll give me an idea whether I'm in the ballpark or not.
1356456	1364811	When we say that we spend too much on things, because we'll hear that quite a bit in a lot of our meetings, people say we're spending too much on, that's where those numbers come from.
1365392	1370120	But we are currently at such a high level that we know we spend too much on IT.
1370621	1373085	We don't know we spend too much on what.
1373386	1380597	So that is a lot of the purpose of why it's there, but we want the product teams to understand is that these capabilities match up to something.
1381138	1387789	When we're saying that, you know, you need to do these, they're important because they're giving us an actual data driven something.
1389331	1391615	You know, we don't know whether we're doing good, bad or indifferent.
1391635	1393538	We only know it from the context of us.
1395138	1405120	the current leadership, the current and a lot of other things are looking at us and the street will look at us and say, are they doing a good job at a high level?
1405481	1408187	And that's always been the number, but the next level down matters.
1409229	1413619	There was the question of, are we spending too much on IT or are we just not making enough money to cover it?
1415557	1416479	So you have two choices.
1416499	1417661	You always have two choices.
1417681	1419083	Do you cut expenses?
1419424	1440400	I hear you and kind of agree but only my question here is now totally it has to be done that way and then there is a thought but now right now we started with this pioneer and the immediate test please correct me okay this is what it's coming in my mind that
1440532	1442535	We do have a capability map.
1442735	1450346	Either we can go with the presentation one or the one which we have pulled it from the Linux tool.
1451107	1455193	And then we will ask the business to get it, verify and do that.
1455353	1461983	And another thing is because we might be at L3 or even below that because we could be at the application level.
1461963	1466470	What could be the different applications are there in that L3?
1466951	1470336	Maybe it's that something outcome that we look for.
1470757	1472260	I mean, this is what it's coming for.
1472280	1474363	It is, but that's being mapped separately right now.
1474423	1478510	That is a separate exercise that's been going on fairly actively right now.
1478630	1483618	I'm actually meeting with, you know, Brian's going to have a communication going out on the application list shortly.
1484780	1486823	Products and applications do not equal.
1487090	1492357	So you could have three applications in a product or you could have one application in a product.
1492417	1493118	It doesn't matter.
1493178	1496743	I mean, like if your workday you may say is, okay, HR core is all in workday.
1496763	1497784	So I have one application.
1498185	1498986	Good.
1499006	1499286	Fine.
1499306	1504813	If you looked at total rewards, total rewards had a dozen applications underneath it.
1504833	1507997	And it, but they were all vendor managed, but they had a bunch of applications underneath them.
1508438	1510401	So they're all, but they're all the same product.
1510501	1512203	They're just different things.
1512672	1515656	So, you know, it was the CCR one stream conversation.
1515796	1519421	If a mitt was the one running CCR, it should be CCR.
1519741	1523666	If a mitt's only running one stream, is one stream the only thing and is there somebody above him?
1524127	1529353	Now, if there isn't, then maybe they have two different, you know, L3s and that's what they have.
1529453	1533478	One is one stream, which we would probably call by its name, not by its product name.
1534540	1537043	You know, the software product name.
1537023	1541307	There's lots of different ways to look at these things, but we are currently working on the application list.
1541327	1545730	That's something else that's being done, and it's being done as AMP because Brian said it should be done as AMP.
1545750	1550895	Shanti has got something.
1550915	1552716	We have 12 minutes left.
1553237	1558501	So my question is, what was the outcome you wanted to achieve on this call?
1558842	1561244	Because I see outcome for vision session.
1561724	1563866	What's the vision session?
1564126	1566388	Who are coming?
1566368	1569692	Unless there's any other questions specifically to this thing.
1570032	1571394	Again, this is an informational thing.
1571434	1576539	If you go with the slide that Chris gave us, it's going to be less hassle, less argument, and it does not going to make really a difference anyway.
1576579	1577580	So I would just go with that.
1578181	1582225	But I'm sure we're going to change something, but that's OK.
1582265	1582846	It doesn't matter.
1582906	1585009	I mean, like you should go with what Chris's is.
1585309	1590595	What you really want to know is if they own a function here, no matter what it's called, if we called it 1.1.1, who cares?
1592036	1593658	What applications they have underneath that?
1594465	1600674	And if they can say that there's applications under that and we can identify a TPO, that's a positive thing because most of our TPO's are wrong in all of our data.
1601214	1604599	So that's a huge step forward, so I would go with it.
1605240	1609165	But is there anything else anybody need to know about what the point of capabilities is?
1612750	1614853	So Carl, yeah, we shall go ahead.
1615954	1623645	So the intent of the session was we wanted to try and understand how to incorporate lean IX into
1624267	1626773	the conversation that we're having with limbs tomorrow.
1627254	1636197	So we have a draft deck that we've created and Prashanti, I'm sharing information and you can opine on what you want us to do with it.
1636598	1640267	So first question is, when we meet with some kids tomorrow,
1641175	1651911	We're going to go over the full value mapping, which is the two slides that I think you guys- Can I see the content, please?
1651931	1653774	I don't want to be assuming.
1654215	1655436	I want to see the content.
1655456	1658822	I want to know who is because I don't see anything on my calendar.
1659062	1661185	So I'm not sure why I'm not invited.
1662507	1669157	So I want to be there to understand what's going on in the sessions because I don't want another escalation from Sanket.
1669863	1670364	Correct, correct.
1670384	1677032	So this is me and Anuj are tagged in, so Rajini, can you forward the session?
1677593	1680857	So this is the product vision session, right?
1680877	1688526	So the first thing that we go over is this, I want Temi and Sanke to first understand the full end-to-end picture.
1688967	1692331	So we're going to go through this slide and this slide, right?
1692551	1694794	Okay, just one feedback, right there.
1694934	1696376	Go back to that slide.
1696957	1697237	Yep.
1697437	1700764	The first zero needs to have OKRs over there.
1700904	1703389	Can view OKRs or can you take in data?
1703409	1705293	I don't want objective and key results.
1705734	1707558	OKR phrase should come there.
1708520	1710464	I'll put it in the brackets, whatever.
1710484	1711887	Can view OKRs?
1711907	1713991	Is that what you want?
1714011	1716055	Yeah, can you take in data?
1716075	1718500	OKRs or whatever.
1719813	1727302	I want the keyword OKR over there because you have put it in step 2 OKR.
1727703	1731257	In step 2 you have to put it as product OKRs.
1731642	1735226	Remember, you all are using language very loosely.
1735266	1742053	This can have an impact because I sat down with Sarah Yaffe and convinced her, your OKRs are here.
1742153	1743694	This is our OKRs.
1743714	1746858	And she was aligned because Sarah Goodman is not convinced.
1746878	1754546	So you need to be very critical because when you're translating into decks, you're losing the feedback that people have given you.
1755246	1755427	OK.
1755447	1755547	Sure.
1756027	1756688	Yeah.
1756708	1758730	So this is the high level view.
1759705	1765494	that is being shared tomorrow, which is the first 10, 15 minutes.
1765674	1773306	Can you please change that to can view OKR on the left, put objective key results in the brackets.
1775569	1780637	I'm sorry, I am very picky on those things because I'm facing the front of it.
1781979	1787788	And you can remove the last key, but yeah, OKR, yeah.
1789928	1791169	So you'll go through this.
1791610	1799079	We're first actually trying to talk about this distinction between SPM and the product model.
1799099	1803003	So I think this slide should be first, but you tell me if you want to cover it afterward.
1803043	1809952	I think this is the SPM story, which is, hey, this is where you start, and then this is how you go around in the circle.
1809992	1811934	This is where we come in, right?
1812014	1814657	This is where we are coming in with our six steps.
1814697	1818822	And then this is where we tie the execution and the business value on the metrics and KPI.
1818802	1834009	So it's basically tying that big picture together that's slide number one slide number two is okay now we'll go into the detailed steps not sessions and steps on how to achieve what we talked about in the previous slide and then I know just go through okay here's
1833989	1836914	We've kept it very light, right?
1836934	1837976	We've kept it high level.
1838437	1846450	Here's what vision means, here's what a vision statement should look like and then we'll go into the workshop saying, okay, here's an example that we gave you for Uber.
1846851	1849956	We want you to put that workshop and then I want you to put it into Jira.
1850425	1853909	So then we're going to go into the JIRA structure, that same standard structure.
1853929	1855290	So let me just go through the slides.
1855590	1858053	I just quickly talked about all this.
1858073	1860876	So first step is here's the vision.
1861056	1863758	Two slides on what is the vision, blah, blah, blah.
1864379	1870866	Next one is you need a vision statement for your product at the product level that has these things captured in it.
1870886	1871726	Who is it for?
1871887	1873088	So where is the template?
1873288	1874429	Where will they capture it?
1874750	1878293	The template is over here at the bottom, which is in the last.
1878313	1879234	What's the template there?
1879805	1880846	put the template next.
1881467	1886715	So you said you're going to teach them, this is not a template, this is an example.
1886755	1888437	Where is the template?
1888457	1892883	So this is what Anuj is saying that, see we are basically asking them to come up with a template.
1892903	1894285	I'm just cutting to the chair.
1894425	1895767	I can share a template.
1896128	1898191	All I am saying is where is the template?
1898531	1900394	I need that template in the next slide.
1900434	1906302	If you're asking them to fill a template, they get a template because this was made clear in the last call
1906282	1910073	It went against the call with Saakeh and Timi.
1910093	1913684	Timi just said, give me a template for Shanti.
1913764	1915369	I'll make him fill the template.
1915690	1917115	And we still are talking.
1917135	1917897	There's a template.
1917917	1918659	There's a template.
1918679	1920063	I don't see the template.
1920083	1920966	Is this a template?
1922195	1923237	Is this a movie?
1923257	1924418	I don't think I have access to it.
1924438	1926241	You might want to look like a template.
1926281	1928044	This is not how the template looks.
1928064	1933673	I'm sorry to say a little bit of executiveness that you have to put over here.
1933713	1936878	If it is who, what, why, how you're just going to randomly put here.
1936898	1940003	They can send it in a email.
1940624	1946673	This is the output of the workshop where I think he's going to do the workshop, which is here's what we're going to go through.
1946994	1947915	Here are the things that
1948098	1954789	If you are giving it, there should be either a mural board, there should be a template where they're putting sticky notes.
1955169	1956692	There needs to be something guys.
1956812	1960498	If you're saying a working session, how will you let them do what?
1960518	1961460	Who is the scribe?
1961800	1969212	Are you going to open a mural board, put four sections and say, hey, drop in your things over there.
1969529	1970390	This is the one there.
1970871	1975279	So this is what screen shot there and say, we are going to capture.
1975319	1978003	They need to be specific steps.
1978144	1979446	You will give five minutes.
1979726	1981289	Have you timed your session?
1981389	1982972	How much time unusual speak?
1983413	1983994	When will you?
1984034	1985817	How much time is this entire thing?
1985837	1987480	We are going to open up a mural board.
1987500	1988782	You know, this takes time.
1989363	1991426	People are thinking people are putting.
1991446	1992769	They might not put anything.
1993309	1993630	So.
1993610	2004448	Are you making them do it in the session or are you going to give them one slider template and say, do however you want but put the vision ultimately?
2004708	2005469	What are you saying?
2006471	2014164	So in this session, Anuj is planning that in this session we will ask, because we are giving them guidance in the session, we are giving them the Uber example.
2014204	2019853	The goal is that they will use that example to fill out the template.
2020660	2021543	That is the intent.
2021904	2023789	Let me just, I think I have access to it now.
2023809	2024351	Thank you.
2025373	2028242	Oh, I think it's still, it's still working, but whatever.
2028262	2030247	So you are throwing me this mural board.
2030308	2031210	What will you tell me?
2031230	2031391	Okay.
2031411	2032193	I am circuit.
2032594	2033356	Walk me through it.
2034339	2035362	What are you asking?
2036236	2037499	Let's do it right then.
2037619	2040885	I'm not sure we have this ready.
2041366	2043571	You don't know how you people are delivering.
2044252	2046015	You all are scrambling with me.
2046456	2051266	One of you showing the mural board, one of you showing the appendix slide.
2051566	2052809	You don't have a game plan.
2052829	2053350	Sorry.
2053330	2076402	you don't none of you have a game plan you have no strategy how you're going to go there you have no strategy how will you ask them to okay you're you're doing a session what will be the output you're saying jeera vishal i see a mural board who is doing what by doing the session i'm doing the opening right i'm doing the opening where i'm giving the big picture
2076668	2080531	and then Anuj is going to walk through the first few slides with the examples.
2080592	2083334	So my story is I'm going to do the opening.
2083574	2085516	How much time is this session?
2085536	2086297	I'm doing 10 minutes.
2086337	2088499	Anuj is doing 50, a 60-minute session.
2089059	2094184	Out of the 50 minutes, Anuj is going to take the first 10, 15 minutes to talk.
2094544	2095945	Hold on, hold on.
2096366	2099288	10 minutes you are done, you will cover your three slides.
2099308	2104573	50 minutes he's doing this workshop, but you were talking about mapping.
2104593	2106675	Where is the mapping part of it?
2106655	2109201	asking them to map.
2109702	2123753	So the theory part is so the next 15, 20 minutes, right, which is the first half hour of the session, we're going to cover the theory, right, which is this is how you do it, which 30 minutes over in the next 30 minutes, what is the industry exactly.
2126028	2133419	session and which is going to give the example so that they can start thinking about, hey, look, let's use the Uber example to talk about this who, what, why, what.
2133999	2141050	Now apply this to your product, and that's where we are introducing the Miro board, which is over here, which is the workshop agenda.
2141450	2143433	This is the 30 minute workshop.
2143453	2145035	Now, when- Where is the mapping?
2145316	2148981	Where are you asking them to map?
2150075	2151658	mapping it back into Jira, right?
2151678	2152460	That's what you're asking.
2152480	2153963	Is that what you want to know?
2153983	2155726	You said Jira, that is one thing.
2155806	2159854	What about we are talking about all these L2T, all these things?
2159875	2161458	Where is that?
2161578	2165205	So that is the part that we were trying to understand today.
2165225	2168151	No, but one number is over, right?
2168890	2173397	One day, we are not even 24 hours away from the session.
2173417	2175500	I don't see a skeleton.
2175520	2178725	I don't see which slide is getting delivered by whom.
2179066	2181570	I don't see how much time we are reserving for work.
2181670	2183032	I see something over here.
2183052	2184755	45 minutes discussion.
2184815	2185836	I'm synthesized.
2186958	2188941	Why should they be even doing it?
2189157	2191700	Along with you, I don't understand these visions.
2192040	2197607	You're not giving them capabilities to say, hey, map your vision to capabilities.
2197627	2198468	You are not.
2198488	2205156	And there was a better slide, a better template of a vision where it had a couple of boxes over there.
2205176	2206958	What is the purpose of the product?
2206978	2207999	What is this?
2208359	2211763	That would automatically give you an end to capability.
2211783	2215047	Because if a circuit says, what's the purpose of lens,
2215027	2219575	Even we might be able to map it to L2, but now you're not asking anything.
2219655	2231416	Just simply putting why, what, when, they're going to give you one line sentences and that will become your vision statement because they are saying, give me a perfect template.
2231836	2233078	I will fill it over there.
2233359	2237406	So if you have all these questions, which applications you map to, which
2237386	2243872	there should be a place in the template which asks for those questions.
2244292	2247896	If you don't ask for those questions, they're not going to answer your question.
2248316	2248777	Got it.
2249097	2256744	So Carl, can you give me that word document that you extracted out of Lean IX where you have the L1, L2, whatever, the other products?
2257044	2264271	If you can just send me that, I'll create a slide that says at the output of this session, these are the things that we want for links.
2264909	2270319	No, your template will not even be influenced by what he's giving.
2270619	2273464	He can give ABCX, YZ, Vishal.
2273825	2275809	Where is my vision template?
2275829	2289313	I'm simply asking all of you guys, where is my vision template which says, hey, there needs to be a question for what are the A2 capabilities, your mapping, who is your sponsor, who is your stakeholders, who is your leader.
2289293	2291476	That's all thing is vision.
2291616	2294501	You're all so focused on piecemealing it.
2295242	2300950	Vision is just what the product... No, as a part of the vision, I want to know all these outlying things.
2300970	2302132	Who is your product owner?
2302252	2303153	Business owner?
2303554	2305036	All these things need to be answered.
2305056	2307439	This is your one shot you're getting with them.
2308060	2311826	In one hour, ask them to fill all the missing information.
2311846	2313709	You people told me, we don't know teams.
2313809	2314710	We don't know.
2314690	2316033	Put all those boxes.
2316053	2324674	There needs to be a pretty template, like a project charter template, a project, a vision template should be there, which is very prescriptive.
2324694	2326078	You don't have to narrate it.
2326619	2331130	Any person should read and be, who is your business partner?
2331818	2333861	Sake should be just simply able to fill it.
2333961	2337505	You don't have to teach him who is a business partner, right?
2337765	2342231	Do you know who the... Sake always keeps saying, hey, I work with my business.
2342431	2343452	I do whatever he says.
2343853	2346656	Do we know who that person is referring to?
2347177	2349881	Does it take requirements from 10 people, one person?
2350581	2351903	Do we know that?
2353047	2356636	If you know it, pre-populate it.
2357679	2366061	If you're saying that you want a template for all six of this, we can just create that and share it with them tomorrow.
2367408	2368129	We can do that.
2368149	2374500	We can give them saying, here's a template for vision, here's a template for product.
2375242	2377786	We have been talking about this for three months now.
2378347	2382194	And what Anuj promised me was for every workshop there's a template.
2382214	2383476	And I don't see a template.
2383496	2384117	I'm sorry.
2384177	2385159	I'm losing it.
2385880	2389987	Either you tell me, Vishanti, you do it, create a template.
2390007	2391370	I'll come and create the template.
2391390	2392251	I'll deliver the template.
2393378	2399348	But I'm not saying we're always talking, hey, this could be one way, that could be one way.
2399508	2407862	Some one way we need, whether we like the template or not, whoever is asking the questions, you need to put that question there so that we get the answers.
2408323	2411168	At the end of the day, I'm really afraid, guys.
2411148	2413411	We will just get four sentences.
2413992	2414713	What is this?
2414733	2418299	He'll say, it's a lab management system that will be answered.
2418399	2419681	I know circuits very well.
2421023	2423827	Then he will say, hey, why do we need it?
2423987	2425830	He'll say, it's a GHP thing.
2425970	2426290	I know.
2426551	2427933	It's a TQ process.
2427993	2429095	We cannot miss it.
2429155	2431538	He's going to give crappy answers, believe me.
2432780	2434062	Then you will say, I don't know.
2434142	2434843	Why what?
2434983	2435264	Who?
2435324	2435765	I don't know.
2436125	2438809	He'll just give you one line sentences.
2438789	2443014	And he'll challenge you, this is what is the template I have answered your questions.
2443154	2444476	Rajini, you know him better.
2444516	2448981	You go with those four answers, you're going to get four sentences.
2451604	2455368	And he's only started, that's why I want to know the participants, who is there?
2455729	2461135	Even if you open a mural board, there will be one, one sticky that he'll place it.
2462735	2463678	Who all are coming?
2463698	2464501	Is Timmy coming?
2464521	2465925	Is Smith coming?
2466086	2468052	Who are the best partners?
2468072	2469236	The best three people.
2469256	2470299	He told only three are enough.
2470460	2472205	Timmy, Smith and himself.
2473906	2478190	So only three people are coming and I asked him, like, do you want to, you know, forward the invite to anybody?
2478210	2480112	So Chris Smith will laugh at this template.
2480152	2482154	If you say, why, what, it's full.
2482534	2485417	He'll say, he's just, then he's going to challenge me.
2485457	2489441	Hold on, hold on, Rajini.
2489861	2495106	Now the conversation I know once, because Timney yesterday you, you heard Rajini, you were there, right?
2495207	2497389	Well, he said, Prashanti, give me a template.
2497569	2498470	I'll populate it.
2498530	2500892	Then my, will my maturity go up?
2501851	2503053	That was his question.
2503293	2506357	I say your maturity won't go up, but we'll give you a template.
2506738	2508040	And this is not a template.
2510743	2512506	Who can come back to me with a template?
2512666	2516311	If I don't get a template, at what time is the session?
2516371	2517453	Tomorrow noon.
2518054	2519356	Tomorrow at noon.
2521699	2524743	But we'll actually have the invite.
2526245	2529630	But what we'll do is, today I think we need to have
2530741	2533987	I think I understand where you are going with this question.
2534007	2536091	I think everybody understands where you're going with this, right?
2536111	2539938	Which is, if I get one hour with you, I'm going to give you everything that I need.
2540298	2542783	I can tell you what the CanVue target and OKR is.
2543504	2545688	I need your product line vision.
2545969	2551078	I need your product group OKRs, product OKRs for Lin specifically.
2551058	2554141	And we'll give them like one or two slides, one slide.
2554281	2557364	And one more question is, we need Chris Serito there.
2557724	2561868	If we are talking about Lee and IH and all, why is Chris missing?
2562368	2563669	Why is Ruchir missing?
2563769	2569895	Or at least Ruchir should have been there as Chris's delegate, right?
2570075	2572718	He is going to support you on those product vision.
2572738	2579564	Whatever, if Chris says, hey, this is not the L2 capabilities, Ruchir has to support you and say, this is the L2 capabilities.
2579604	2581065	Why is he missing?
2581045	2582768	These are the people.
2582788	2584431	You need to think about the audience.
2584672	2588579	As we are changing the scope, we need to get the right audience there.
2588679	2591665	If Chris cannot be there, who is the next best person?
2591705	2592066	Ruchit.
2592386	2596093	If Ruchit cannot be there, we still make them optional and go forwards.
2596454	2601383	Because unless we bring Chris and Chris Smith, Chris Serito and Chris Smith,
2601363	2603306	They will never come into an alignment.
2603346	2610395	We need to bring them, do a face-off and say, hey, you people fight it out and tell me, come out of this session with one.
2611076	2612638	That's our victory, right?
2612698	2614480	Because we are running with two things.
2615041	2617144	Make them meet and talk in that session.
2617184	2618886	They might quarrel.
2619006	2619527	It's okay.
2620068	2621350	Mediate that discussion.
2621650	2629300	And when you come out of that discussion, we should have one list or aligned list where we know Chris Smith and Chris Cerrito agrees.
2629420	2630762	That is a victory.
2630742	2634827	I want to define what is success of our thing.
2634847	2643977	We can just give this course and come out and we can be again talking about there are two lists or any of the problem and say there is one list right now.
2644158	2647121	Because what does Brian Radisab is going to go and do?
2647221	2649704	He'll have a separate conversation with Chris Serito.
2649724	2650665	He'll have a separate one.
2650946	2651326	No.
2652167	2653609	Now rubber hits the road.
2654209	2656692	Why are we catching a capability list to the vision?
2657133	2659095	Why are we not trying to get the vision right?
2660324	2662388	We're not.
2664272	2671606	The goal was to try and get as much as possible in one session instead of having multiple sessions, but we don't have to.
2671847	2678400	I understand that, but I don't think that we're ready to go and say which one of these things do you map up to if this stuff is still being debated and being reviewed.
2680000	2683786	But I heard there was already an alignment.
2683806	2685929	That's how it went into linearity.
2685949	2690496	So I just want to remind Chris Matt, this is already aligned and accepted.
2690516	2692299	So why are you changing the structure?
2692780	2695143	I want a second objective to come up.
2695163	2697086	We have all the right people in the room.
2697167	2701333	Why are we hesitating to ask the right questions?
2701313	2705241	Because we know it's a lingering problem, can we fix the lingering issue?
2705962	2709810	You're trying to fix Chris Cerudo's problem with the product model.
2710291	2715482	And by doing that, you're going to have an issue, I mean, you need them to have a vision statement.
2715762	2719069	The success for the product model is they have the vision statement.
2719049	2729086	How can a vision statement be drafted without knowing what capability they are supporting?
2729106	2730609	Because that's the purpose, right?
2731050	2735978	In reality, they should be able to say, I am going to support this
2735958	2739523	Well, yes and no.
2739543	2741085	We've already made the decision.
2741265	2744330	If we made the decision to go from the bottom up, it doesn't matter nearly as much.
2744510	2745711	They know what they're targeting.
2746272	2755685	If you're going to say that the vision statement is going to be done the right way, then we would have started with L1s and we would have gotten them to give us one that would have been used for L2s.
2755725	2756827	It would have been used for L3s.
2757147	2758309	We're starting at L3s.
2758729	2763636	So what we really have is the success is that they come out with a vision statement.
2765185	2771671	Sorry, I have to go, but you guys know brainstorm it, but I need a template.
2772012	2774334	I need a format, how we are going through.
2774854	2779419	I'm going to do some offline conversation.
2779519	2782602	I'm trying to bring Chris Smith and Chris Ferrito together.
2782642	2788728	Whether in that call or a separate, let me get back to you how that goes.
2788748	2790670	For now, I need to know.
2790650	2793633	In respect, forget which capability metrics.
2793653	2799880	At least we all agree that a product should support a capability.
2799900	2804606	Wherever it is, however it is, they should support some R&D capability.
2805186	2811413	As long as they can articulate that in their own words, then we can match that capability in our taxonomy.
2811434	2817180	But they need to be able to say, this product delivers some capability.
2817160	2825463	If that can be there in that vision template, that is what I'm looking towards.
2825744	2828130	And then we will see how to map that.
2828150	2831760	But they need to say which business capable.
