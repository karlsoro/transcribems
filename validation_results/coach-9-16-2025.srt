1
00:00:03,642 --> 00:00:25,752
maybe let's give one more minute for Vishal to join in then he gets started so today we wanted to talk about okay it is Satish who has joined okay

2
00:00:26,356 --> 00:00:39,218
We wanted to talk about the taxonomy and after that we also wanted to touch upon what are the outcomes that we are planning to achieve.

3
00:00:39,687 --> 00:00:41,269
by end of the vision statement.

4
00:00:41,829 --> 00:00:42,670
There was a discussion.

5
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:44,813
There's a thought Prashanti has shared that with us.

6
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:46,154
She's looking for three things.

7
00:00:46,194 --> 00:00:53,703
One is the vision statement, then L2, L3 capabilities and the mapping to the respective application.

8
00:00:53,943 --> 00:00:55,105
So that's the three things.

9
00:00:55,185 --> 00:01:02,353
But then here is the first step like building that the standing and modifying the content for the vision workshop tomorrow.

10
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:03,095
accordingly.

11
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:05,099
That's the plan.

12
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,189
So Kaal, I think we have full house, Anuj may not be able to join.

13
00:01:09,249 --> 00:01:10,793
He has some medical emergency.

14
00:01:11,334 --> 00:01:12,276
That's what he shared.

15
00:01:12,396 --> 00:01:15,263
So we can get started.

16
00:01:15,597 --> 00:01:16,419
over to you.

17
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:17,220
We are all yours.

18
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:17,721
Sure.

19
00:01:18,282 --> 00:01:18,523
Sure.

20
00:01:18,543 --> 00:01:24,935
I mean, and a lot of what we were covering was, I mean, it seems to be that there's people don't know what a business capability is or how business capability maps are.

21
00:01:25,336 --> 00:01:29,944
I'm not looking at what our business capability map is, because there's still some stuff up in the air there.

22
00:01:30,065 --> 00:01:34,433
We had some conversation over the last couple of days of

23
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:46,402
There is a version in Lean IX, which currently is considered the Kenview version, but there's also some discussion about whether or not the Lean IX version is right or not, so we'll continue to have those discussions.

24
00:01:47,123 --> 00:01:52,509
But my bigger thing is understanding what a business capability map and how it works into the product model.

25
00:01:52,569 --> 00:01:55,372
What does a business capability map have to do with a product model?

26
00:01:56,133 --> 00:01:58,796
They are very, very much linked.

27
00:01:59,417 --> 00:02:04,302
And by definition, if you look at the design of a product model by anybody

28
00:02:05,243 --> 00:02:08,306
Actually, I was just looking yesterday at seven different product models.

29
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:09,587
There's seven different versions.

30
00:02:09,627 --> 00:02:13,831
The product model that I've been able to locate, of the seven, every single one of them uses.

31
00:02:13,891 --> 00:02:21,677
Sorry, I just got some, the bing that you have to pay attention to.

32
00:02:22,418 --> 00:02:30,685
In the product model, what they're doing in a lot of cases is what you're doing exactly what we're looking at.

33
00:02:30,805 --> 00:02:33,748
When you talk about a line to a group,

34
00:02:34,167 --> 00:02:35,469
to a team.

35
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,093
You're looking at capabilities.

36
00:02:38,493 --> 00:02:41,598
A line is a high level, a level one capability.

37
00:02:41,678 --> 00:02:46,445
A product group is a level two capability and a level three capability is a team.

38
00:02:47,025 --> 00:02:48,648
That's why they're defined the way they are.

39
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:52,293
We had a definition that was used to category software.

40
00:02:52,754 --> 00:02:54,156
We're changing from that definition.

41
00:02:54,276 --> 00:02:55,357
We're moving out of that definition.

42
00:02:55,377 --> 00:02:57,741
There's a copa version that was used there.

43
00:02:58,161 --> 00:03:00,765
Copa is a standards organization.

44
00:03:00,745 --> 00:03:05,012
the standards organization of the CPG business is what it's from.

45
00:03:05,893 --> 00:03:06,714
We won't be using that one.

46
00:03:06,815 --> 00:03:08,057
There are some changes from there.

47
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:12,283
There's a couple other models that are out there that are fairly common.

48
00:03:12,844 --> 00:03:19,234
About five of them use the same model, but for the most part there's different models.

49
00:03:19,675 --> 00:03:27,968
So I'm intentionally going to use a graphic from, and I will share in a second as soon as I find it,

50
00:03:28,133 --> 00:03:30,656
A graphic that's... this is how it looks.

51
00:03:30,676 --> 00:03:31,617
This isn't ours.

52
00:03:32,418 --> 00:03:33,599
It has nothing to do with ours.

53
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:41,168
I don't want to use ours for a very good reason, is that ours is up in the air and I don't want people to get confused by what's going to be there.

54
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,453
So, if I can just find this stupid thing.

55
00:03:46,654 --> 00:03:48,176
I will share it.

56
00:03:50,679 --> 00:03:51,459
Alright, where did it go?

57
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:56,205
That's not the one.

58
00:03:56,685 --> 00:03:58,107
That is ours, okay.

59
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:07,360
And I am working currently on, as part of another process, I'm working on what ours will look like somewhat.

60
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:16,190
I need to get agreement from a couple of people before I can say so, because whether we're gonna have one or two and things like that, because there's a lot of different thought processes out there.

61
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,433
So, where did it go?

62
00:04:20,274 --> 00:04:20,955
There it is, okay.

63
00:04:22,116 --> 00:04:23,138
Now I have to go back to sharing.

64
00:04:23,758 --> 00:04:25,360
I had to find it before I could share it.

65
00:04:27,888 --> 00:04:47,287
The fun of working on a Mac is you have multiple screens, and I can't find the stupid thing on the screen I want it to be on.

66
00:04:48,508 --> 00:04:50,530
Alright, I'll open it again.

67
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:52,692
I can't show it.

68
00:04:52,712 --> 00:04:54,013
Alright, let me try this.

69
00:04:54,331 --> 00:04:56,858
if I share my entire thing just because it's easier that way.

70
00:04:58,723 --> 00:05:01,972
And then you can tell me whether or not you can see it when I get it.

71
00:05:02,213 --> 00:05:03,657
Where'd it go?

72
00:05:03,677 --> 00:05:03,918
All right.

73
00:05:03,998 --> 00:05:05,101
If I share my screen, can you see that?

74
00:05:05,462 --> 00:05:06,966
Are you seeing a big box?

75
00:05:06,986 --> 00:05:07,748
Okay.

76
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:08,932
Cool.

77
00:05:08,952 --> 00:05:09,253
All right.

78
00:05:09,373 --> 00:05:10,095
Now.

79
00:05:10,312 --> 00:05:13,719
When I talk about L1s, then this is where you'll start to see where things happen.

80
00:05:13,739 --> 00:05:20,151
When you talk about L1s, where you see operating processes here or management and support processes, those are L1s.

81
00:05:20,532 --> 00:05:29,449
Those usually have a VP over them at a VP level that would be responsible for operating processes and what the goals are for that operating processes group.

82
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,134
So if we were to look at

83
00:05:32,435 --> 00:05:33,897
probably Eleanor is the best mix.

84
00:05:34,058 --> 00:05:44,614
Eleanor and our company has enterprise services, which includes corporate services and it includes supply chain, which is sometimes done, sometimes not.

85
00:05:44,674 --> 00:05:45,776
It's a little unique on its own.

86
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:53,228
But what comes in after that normally would then be where do you take the things that are inside of?

87
00:05:53,596 --> 00:05:54,438
enterprise services.

88
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:56,383
So enterprise services has a lot of different systems.

89
00:05:57,105 --> 00:05:59,692
Okay, we have a lot of different things, but they're grouped together.

90
00:05:59,772 --> 00:06:02,559
So maybe we were to say is I'm going to do corporate systems.

91
00:06:04,384 --> 00:06:07,692
Now the thing that gets lost quite often is you can have multiple capabilities under there.

92
00:06:07,732 --> 00:06:10,339
So you might say corporate systems is one of these boxes.

93
00:06:12,057 --> 00:06:13,380
Well, what do we have in corporate systems?

94
00:06:14,102 --> 00:06:15,566
Well, we can have finance systems.

95
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:16,769
We can have HR systems.

96
00:06:16,829 --> 00:06:18,213
But what is the capability?

97
00:06:18,273 --> 00:06:19,015
What are they doing?

98
00:06:19,596 --> 00:06:27,957
So if I were to look at HR and say, what are the actual capabilities that would make up these blue boxes in this case?

99
00:06:27,937 --> 00:06:33,164
I would look at things like if I said I was in corporate systems and I had capabilities inside corporate systems.

100
00:06:33,204 --> 00:06:36,908
Now HR can be grouped in there as its own or as something different.

101
00:06:37,008 --> 00:06:38,670
You could make HR one of these boxes.

102
00:06:39,672 --> 00:06:40,553
People do it different ways.

103
00:06:40,813 --> 00:06:44,978
So if we were to say HR was one of these yellow blocks, HR has capabilities.

104
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:48,142
You have core HCM, which is things like workday.

105
00:06:48,983 --> 00:06:52,808
You have compensations, which could be in total reward.

106
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,813
You could have

107
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:02,454
talent recruiting, which is another part of all of that.

108
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:07,987
Now those would normally have a leader in the yellow box, in that case it would be Jessica in our case because we've dealt with Jessica.

109
00:07:08,308 --> 00:07:11,275
And the blue box is what you would see is the

110
00:07:11,491 --> 00:07:13,795
folks that we're working with, and I can't remember what her name is.

111
00:07:14,215 --> 00:07:15,598
Generally, it would actually be somebody more.

112
00:07:15,758 --> 00:07:18,803
Now, we have an extra layer in the corporate end of the world.

113
00:07:19,204 --> 00:07:20,606
So we do have extra people in there.

114
00:07:21,227 --> 00:07:24,913
But if we were to split off HR on its own, we wouldn't.

115
00:07:24,953 --> 00:07:28,058
If we said HR and compensation is that, then you'd have just owning two boxes.

116
00:07:28,679 --> 00:07:29,881
That's why it gets confused.

117
00:07:30,322 --> 00:07:37,954
But what we're trying to do is say is, what I need to know is, what are my high level lines so that I have a leader here that's

118
00:07:38,373 --> 00:07:41,317
aligning with that business side of that.

119
00:07:41,337 --> 00:07:43,601
These don't just apply to technology.

120
00:07:43,641 --> 00:07:45,083
They apply to technology and business.

121
00:07:45,964 --> 00:07:57,400
So if I were to be able to apply both of them and say, okay, in the business, we have a set of goals, those goals come cascading down when we talk about cost savings.

122
00:07:57,801 --> 00:08:01,326
Maybe at operating process, we want to save

123
00:08:03,095 --> 00:08:07,242
50 million dollars and we have six boxes here.

124
00:08:07,763 --> 00:08:19,404
We may split that six boxes into six parts and say you each have to do one or we may do it unevenly because of the impact each group has.

125
00:08:19,464 --> 00:08:21,408
That would be where that cascaded goal would come from.

126
00:08:21,488 --> 00:08:26,757
So the vision of operating processes is to shorten work times and reduce costs.

127
00:08:27,462 --> 00:08:29,324
Okay, that vision is gonna cascade down.

128
00:08:29,804 --> 00:08:38,171
It's gonna cascade down to the things, what impact they can have, then those will get down to the team level to say which individual team should be supporting in what level.

129
00:08:38,632 --> 00:08:40,093
So the goal doesn't change.

130
00:08:40,914 --> 00:08:45,117
The portion of the goal that the teams can actually impact changes.

131
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,460
So that's when you're looking at your vision.

132
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,661
The vision doesn't change.

133
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:54,025
The vision becomes specified much more detailed to what you can do.

134
00:08:54,946 --> 00:08:57,148
So if they said, yeah, go ahead.

135
00:08:58,006 --> 00:09:00,328
question for you.

136
00:09:00,348 --> 00:09:09,836
Can we say that this is a guideline for teams to define what their L1 capabilities are?

137
00:09:11,658 --> 00:09:18,024
Well, L1 is a product line.

138
00:09:18,864 --> 00:09:22,928
Teams wouldn't define what their product line is.

139
00:09:23,648 --> 00:09:27,692
Corporate systems, if you were going into who's going first?

140
00:09:28,465 --> 00:09:29,886
Who's going tomorrow?

141
00:09:31,828 --> 00:09:48,304
Okay, so you may be looking at, you know, research and development as being the product line, which is probably, may or may not be part of operations, but that's okay.

142
00:09:48,324 --> 00:09:56,532
So let's assume that R&D was this thing, rather than operating processes, this said research and development, and you were going into the lab services.

143
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,007
There could be two teams, there could be three teams, there could be multiple software packages.

144
00:10:01,508 --> 00:10:11,148
So their L1 would then be R&D, their L2 would be lab services, and their individual teams, limbs being one of them, would be an L3.

145
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:18,283
So then the level three capability is lab, I forget what limbs does now, lab monitoring and notebooking.

146
00:10:19,343 --> 00:10:27,551
So how do I translate this into business capabilities that I'm trying to like I'm maybe just as me.

147
00:10:27,571 --> 00:10:33,076
Well, yeah, again, it's this is where we run into a problem here at Kenview because we haven't really settled on something.

148
00:10:33,096 --> 00:10:38,361
There are industry definitions that say this is the capabilities that you do in the company.

149
00:10:39,081 --> 00:10:43,105
We can use those or we can use what they define if they want to call limbs.

150
00:10:44,066 --> 00:10:46,228
I am the lab management platforms.

151
00:10:46,698 --> 00:10:47,039
Okay.

152
00:10:47,239 --> 00:10:48,281
Your lab management platforms.

153
00:10:48,301 --> 00:10:49,403
Do you have any more than one system?

154
00:10:49,623 --> 00:10:50,024
Maybe not.

155
00:10:50,485 --> 00:10:51,427
It's possible they don't.

156
00:10:52,128 --> 00:10:54,032
It could be their lab management platforms.

157
00:10:54,072 --> 00:10:56,376
Then their blue box would say lab management platforms.

158
00:10:58,941 --> 00:11:00,003
Which is fine.

159
00:11:00,063 --> 00:11:03,148
I mean, they can define whatever they want to put there.

160
00:11:03,389 --> 00:11:10,562
The problem I think we have right now is that we have multiple places where we've already gathered this information multiple times.

161
00:11:10,863 --> 00:11:12,265
and everybody's getting different answers.

162
00:11:12,967 --> 00:11:17,334
So we have to figure out who is the source of truth or what is the source of truth and stick to one.

163
00:11:17,955 --> 00:11:21,301
So right now what I'm using is what actually happens to be in Lean IX.

164
00:11:22,283 --> 00:11:28,153
So if I were to look at what's in Lean IX, Lean IX has a set of things.

165
00:11:28,193 --> 00:11:28,975
Let me see if I can find it.

166
00:11:29,135 --> 00:11:30,998
I probably can because I think I had it open.

167
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:37,014
I think she just stepped out as well.

168
00:11:37,174 --> 00:11:44,177
What I understood here is the L1 is kind of equivalent to the product line.

169
00:11:44,798 --> 00:11:49,582
That's what we are seeing it, which particularly talks about what your product does.

170
00:11:50,463 --> 00:11:51,984
Not product, product line does.

171
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:53,626
That's what in combination.

172
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:54,947
That's what it is.

173
00:11:55,087 --> 00:11:57,749
And then we have not tested upon L2 and L3.

174
00:11:57,789 --> 00:12:00,572
But who defined these L1, L2, L3?

175
00:12:00,612 --> 00:12:04,375
Who are the responsible person who has to define these?

176
00:12:05,956 --> 00:12:08,639
Well, right now what we have is, I don't even actually know.

177
00:12:08,739 --> 00:12:13,523
I mean, architecture worked with a bunch of senior leaders to come up with a number of definitions.

178
00:12:14,802 --> 00:12:19,208
So that is who defined the ones that we have.

179
00:12:19,228 --> 00:12:21,891
So can you see a business capability index I have for Lean IX here?

180
00:12:24,094 --> 00:12:25,936
I can see the screen.

181
00:12:26,297 --> 00:12:35,289
Okay, so if I look at this, now if I look at the L ones that they have defined, you would look at this and say, okay, here, my product line is R&D and engineer.

182
00:12:37,972 --> 00:12:38,873
Makes sense, right?

183
00:12:39,033 --> 00:12:40,275
It's a rational thing, because it's there.

184
00:12:40,315 --> 00:12:41,417
Those are already defined.

185
00:12:42,278 --> 00:12:44,100
Normally there's eight, we have 33.

186
00:12:45,903 --> 00:12:50,189
Then if I came down again a little level down to L2s, now I would see is okay.

187
00:12:50,209 --> 00:12:51,051
Well, there's a bunch of them.

188
00:12:51,111 --> 00:12:52,272
So wait, this is limb.

189
00:12:52,292 --> 00:12:55,517
So this is going to be, you know, 21 too.

190
00:12:55,657 --> 00:12:58,802
So it was the R&D in engineering and lab management.

191
00:12:59,002 --> 00:13:02,628
Now, if I want to get to level three, cause they have an additional level here.

192
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:07,515
And theoretically this is an additional level because they're, they missed them.

193
00:13:07,535 --> 00:13:12,923
Oh, but let's, then I come down to 21.

194
00:13:15,822 --> 00:13:21,430
Now they could be limbs itself could be one of these lab management data.

195
00:13:21,491 --> 00:13:24,275
So maybe they're 2123 lab data management.

196
00:13:27,119 --> 00:13:32,828
And they're different than whoever is doing lab data visualization or real material management or any of the other management.

197
00:13:33,549 --> 00:13:38,857
So assuming that these are the correct ones because these are the ones that are set up currently in lean IX.

198
00:13:39,478 --> 00:13:41,521
And they're pretty adamant about keeping them that way.

199
00:13:41,561 --> 00:13:42,943
They're not going to change them at this point.

200
00:13:43,565 --> 00:13:45,627
So just one question, Karl.

201
00:13:46,348 --> 00:13:49,972
I think, at least let's take the example of R&D.

202
00:13:51,614 --> 00:13:58,803
I'm not sure if you have access, maybe we can look at it, download and see what Linaix has.

203
00:13:59,363 --> 00:14:07,352
But my understanding is Chris Smith has already defined his L1, L2, L3 capabilities.

204
00:14:08,093 --> 00:14:10,416
And based on what I'm hearing,

205
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:14,134
I mean, there's nobody else deciding these things.

206
00:14:14,154 --> 00:14:16,998
It's us or it's them, right?

207
00:14:17,098 --> 00:14:24,048
We have not taken a stab and said, Brian has not told us saying that we'll go with the industry best practices.

208
00:14:24,269 --> 00:14:26,892
Somebody at his level has to make a decision.

209
00:14:27,053 --> 00:14:29,556
This is the Lean IX data that we're looking at right now.

210
00:14:29,576 --> 00:14:31,219
This is not industry best practices.

211
00:14:31,699 --> 00:14:34,243
This specifically is Lean IX.

212
00:14:34,564 --> 00:14:36,807
Okay, let me see what I have.

213
00:14:37,428 --> 00:14:40,993
I have what Chris gave me was one second.

214
00:14:43,117 --> 00:14:48,327
He has given, if you don't mind I'll steal the chair for one second and I'll give it back to you.

215
00:14:48,968 --> 00:14:49,749
Okay.

216
00:14:49,769 --> 00:14:53,075
This is what he has given me unless it has changed.

217
00:14:53,115 --> 00:14:58,425
I don't know what's the latest, but this is what he's saying is art is.

218
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:02,270
These are his L2 capabilities, these are the L3.

219
00:15:02,671 --> 00:15:10,102
So according to him, these are the product, no, I think this is product line, product groups and products.

220
00:15:10,403 --> 00:15:11,925
This is how they are looking at it.

221
00:15:12,306 --> 00:15:18,675
And then maybe LIMS falls under regulatory, I don't know, regulatory or clinical, I'm not sure.

222
00:15:18,655 --> 00:15:21,960
But this is what I was expecting to see in Linux.

223
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:28,509
If this is not matching, then we need... And that will never end up in Linux because those aren't actual categories.

224
00:15:28,549 --> 00:15:34,097
Those are actually... Medical safety is not a category because it could fit in 50 different places.

225
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,723
It's not going to show up in capabilities.

226
00:15:37,783 --> 00:15:43,431
Now, what Chris has here, my understanding is he got this agreed upon with senior leaders.

227
00:15:44,288 --> 00:15:45,330
we're following up.

228
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:46,492
I had a conversation with Brian on it.

229
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:48,455
We're having some follow-up with it on it already.

230
00:15:48,516 --> 00:15:55,528
But the idea was, do we adapt to what Lean IX is saying, or do we let every single group do it the way they want to do it?

231
00:15:55,608 --> 00:16:02,781
Because the problem that we have, and I think it's a little off track of the conversation we're having here, because we can let them tell us anything they want.

232
00:16:03,222 --> 00:16:05,706
We have to make a decision on what

233
00:16:05,686 --> 00:16:06,828
chart we're going to use.

234
00:16:07,188 --> 00:16:09,331
There's a hundred charts out there.

235
00:16:09,352 --> 00:16:11,314
Unfortunately, I'm stopping my share.

236
00:16:11,695 --> 00:16:14,700
If you give me that list, I'm going to take both of them.

237
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:22,571
I'm going to send it to Chris Smith and Chris Cerito, coffee, Brian, you and Sarah, and say, pick one.

238
00:16:22,591 --> 00:16:23,493
We are moving forward.

239
00:16:23,513 --> 00:16:25,295
Yeah, and Brian and Sarah already have this.

240
00:16:25,356 --> 00:16:28,701
Because unfortunately, I am not getting that empowerment.

241
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:30,023
Okay, it's already on Brian's desk.

242
00:16:30,063 --> 00:16:30,904
Brian already has it.

243
00:16:30,924 --> 00:16:32,727
He's had it for a few days and he's going through it.

244
00:16:32,847 --> 00:16:33,668
So

245
00:16:33,648 --> 00:16:36,712
You can check on his status with it and let's go that way.

246
00:16:36,832 --> 00:16:43,181
Can you just give me the two letters R and D and then shall both of them R and D?

247
00:16:43,201 --> 00:16:44,143
But it's actually not that.

248
00:16:44,163 --> 00:16:46,846
What I'm trying to do is explain why we do it the way we do it.

249
00:16:47,167 --> 00:16:48,469
What chart we use doesn't matter.

250
00:16:48,569 --> 00:16:50,591
And I don't want to go too far off of what chart.

251
00:16:51,032 --> 00:16:52,995
We know there's questions of which chart we're going to use.

252
00:16:53,075 --> 00:16:55,318
I don't want to get stuck in that.

253
00:16:55,585 --> 00:16:59,192
The idea is we keep talking about business capabilities.

254
00:16:59,653 --> 00:17:06,427
For us, if we ask people to map to some capabilities, we have to give them capabilities to say map it, right?

255
00:17:06,808 --> 00:17:09,533
Now, which capability will put in front of them?

256
00:17:09,553 --> 00:17:11,417
We try to put whatever is at risk.

257
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:32,595
aligned and then if they want to throw some dots evolve that that's up to them but at this point of time the direction I've got is don't disrupt anything if there's something already existing just go with it that's the strong direction I have received but but I might be wrong there might be something else that's going on right now

258
00:17:32,575 --> 00:17:37,905
This team is looking for cardless, not like, hey, maybe this or that.

259
00:17:38,025 --> 00:17:41,732
We need to go with one list so that they can finish the activity of mapping.

260
00:17:41,752 --> 00:17:47,483
Because if we put two lists in front of Rajini and say, hey, ask them, they can map here.

261
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:48,385
This is better.

262
00:17:48,405 --> 00:17:50,549
This is Chris says, you can map here.

263
00:17:50,609 --> 00:17:52,092
This is what Chris Smith says.

264
00:17:52,533 --> 00:17:54,035
It will be very confusing to them.

265
00:17:54,055 --> 00:17:55,478
We need to give them one list.

266
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:58,026
Let Chris Smith and Chris said it or fight it out.

267
00:17:58,668 --> 00:18:03,544
One list comes out of it and that list goes to this training as simple as that.

268
00:18:04,402 --> 00:18:06,966
And Prishanthi, I have a follow up question on that.

269
00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:11,272
So you have shared that, you know, that slide that we have it from long, right?

270
00:18:11,933 --> 00:18:13,536
It talks about L2L3.

271
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:20,466
So when we are in a workshop, are we asking the business to verify it, whether this is correct or not?

272
00:18:20,786 --> 00:18:23,450
Because it's the audience.

273
00:18:23,631 --> 00:18:27,436
Whoever we have invited, I'm assuming they are the decision makers over there.

274
00:18:27,877 --> 00:18:29,579
It could be the technical leader.

275
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:31,202
It could be the business.

276
00:18:31,342 --> 00:18:32,704
It's a collaborative thing.

277
00:18:32,684 --> 00:18:40,354
If they are saying, hey, this application, hey, there is this, whatever, ana plan, this is the demand planning.

278
00:18:40,754 --> 00:18:45,500
Yes, the technical person is saying this, does the business person agree?

279
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:47,583
Are his capabilities delivered?

280
00:18:47,803 --> 00:18:50,807
Do they use ana plan for supply planning?

281
00:18:50,847 --> 00:18:51,949
That's the biggest question.

282
00:18:52,229 --> 00:18:56,194
If yes, yes, yes, that's the application.

283
00:18:56,596 --> 00:18:59,701
That's the capability, that's how you manage it.

284
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:04,428
And then we might be just talking about one product here because we are just talking pioneers.

285
00:19:04,809 --> 00:19:10,257
But ideally, like Karli is saying, we should do top-down, but we are not in that space.

286
00:19:10,277 --> 00:19:11,439
We are doing bottom-up.

287
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:21,675
So maybe in that entire hierarchy, it's only one box you're going to pick up and say, hey, these two applications, we have been talking about maps to the supply plan.

288
00:19:21,993 --> 00:19:22,413
That's it.

289
00:19:23,034 --> 00:19:24,456
You mapped it, done.

290
00:19:25,076 --> 00:19:27,459
Then you say, okay, the product, whatever.

291
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:32,845
Finalize the name, finalize the L2 capability, finalize the applications.

292
00:19:32,965 --> 00:19:36,269
That's your two-way mapping, right?

293
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,191
At least stop there.

294
00:19:38,231 --> 00:19:39,933
We are not going to boil the ocean.

295
00:19:39,953 --> 00:19:42,616
At this point of time, it's too late.

296
00:19:42,696 --> 00:19:45,579
We have been debating on this three months, four months.

297
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:46,520
We don't have an answer.

298
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:51,105
Unfortunately, I'm ready to make a decision today if

299
00:19:51,085 --> 00:19:52,848
somebody gave me the option.

300
00:19:53,149 --> 00:19:56,935
Carl will make it today if somebody empowered him, right?

301
00:19:57,036 --> 00:20:02,525
If Brian told Carl, you are 100% accountable for this structure, go put it.

302
00:20:02,986 --> 00:20:09,939
I'm sure he'll come up with the best in class taxonomy and we can say this is the taxonomy I like to it.

303
00:20:10,339 --> 00:20:11,862
But nobody is empowering us.

304
00:20:11,842 --> 00:20:13,465
That's the biggest problem.

305
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:16,912
Without empowerment, we can be talking, talking, talking.

306
00:20:16,932 --> 00:20:19,898
We might be having the best taxonomy in the world.

307
00:20:19,998 --> 00:20:25,108
We cannot operationalize it because the leaders are not supporting.

308
00:20:25,426 --> 00:20:33,835
I mean, in the end, it's owned by architecture in the end, because they're the ones who have to set this up for the... But please don't say no, I'm not in public.

309
00:20:33,855 --> 00:20:34,496
I understood.

310
00:20:35,236 --> 00:20:39,461
But they do have a setup, and we are having the discussion whether or not we just go with it.

311
00:20:39,481 --> 00:20:44,406
And right now, they don't want to change anything again, because they're going to miss all their dates, because they have to get their stuff in there.

312
00:20:44,747 --> 00:20:52,615
But the reality of it is, what we really need to understand is how this stuff relates to what we're talking about, and how do we explain it to people.

313
00:20:52,595 --> 00:20:55,558
What it is can be debated forever.

314
00:20:55,618 --> 00:20:58,861
If a bunch of leaders want to go argue 50 different times, I don't care.

315
00:20:58,881 --> 00:21:07,310
The reality of it is, is there's a direct mapping between business capabilities and lines and groups and teams.

316
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:08,691
That's how the two go together.

317
00:21:08,711 --> 00:21:10,213
And they go together for that way for a reason.

318
00:21:10,693 --> 00:21:15,318
There's the reasoning behind this in a lot of cases is when you're dealing with a product model.

319
00:21:15,538 --> 00:21:19,682
For one product doesn't necessarily fit every single type of organization, but

320
00:21:19,662 --> 00:21:29,355
By understanding where the business capabilities are, they do fit every organization, no matter what kind of organization it is, whether it's an infrastructure or a R&D organization, it doesn't matter.

321
00:21:30,256 --> 00:21:35,362
The idea is that what it gives us is a standard methodology for understanding how we're doing.

322
00:21:35,543 --> 00:21:37,185
So you can set metrics.

323
00:21:37,205 --> 00:21:43,152
You can say, am I spending on this capability in the same range as my competition?

324
00:21:44,314 --> 00:21:48,319
Am I delivering time frame wise?

325
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:51,282
in direct alignment with my competition.

326
00:21:51,383 --> 00:21:59,274
By putting capabilities in it as a rational way and mapping those capabilities in a standard way, it gives us an ability to go against other information that we have.

327
00:21:59,814 --> 00:22:03,640
Now we can do that data and analytics and data driven decision making that makes sense.

328
00:22:04,421 --> 00:22:08,046
If we say we now want to invest in growth,

329
00:22:09,427 --> 00:22:17,217
If we're overspending in five places, but we're underspending on the things that help with growth, we know where we can move things around in a very rational way and make sense.

330
00:22:17,838 --> 00:22:22,784
The idea behind the business capability model is that ability to attach ourselves to something.

331
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:32,616
If I go to Gartner and say, what is the average that a CPG company of over $5 billion will spend on HR?

332
00:22:33,912 --> 00:22:36,436
it'll give me an idea whether I'm in the ballpark or not.

333
00:22:36,456 --> 00:22:44,811
When we say that we spend too much on things, because we'll hear that quite a bit in a lot of our meetings, people say we're spending too much on, that's where those numbers come from.

334
00:22:45,392 --> 00:22:50,120
But we are currently at such a high level that we know we spend too much on IT.

335
00:22:50,621 --> 00:22:53,085
We don't know we spend too much on what.

336
00:22:53,386 --> 00:23:00,597
So that is a lot of the purpose of why it's there, but we want the product teams to understand is that these capabilities match up to something.

337
00:23:01,138 --> 00:23:07,789
When we're saying that, you know, you need to do these, they're important because they're giving us an actual data driven something.

338
00:23:09,331 --> 00:23:11,615
You know, we don't know whether we're doing good, bad or indifferent.

339
00:23:11,635 --> 00:23:13,538
We only know it from the context of us.

340
00:23:15,138 --> 00:23:25,120
the current leadership, the current and a lot of other things are looking at us and the street will look at us and say, are they doing a good job at a high level?

341
00:23:25,481 --> 00:23:28,187
And that's always been the number, but the next level down matters.

342
00:23:29,229 --> 00:23:33,619
There was the question of, are we spending too much on IT or are we just not making enough money to cover it?

343
00:23:35,557 --> 00:23:36,479
So you have two choices.

344
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:37,661
You always have two choices.

345
00:23:37,681 --> 00:23:39,083
Do you cut expenses?

346
00:23:39,424 --> 00:24:00,400
I hear you and kind of agree but only my question here is now totally it has to be done that way and then there is a thought but now right now we started with this pioneer and the immediate test please correct me okay this is what it's coming in my mind that

347
00:24:00,532 --> 00:24:02,535
We do have a capability map.

348
00:24:02,735 --> 00:24:10,346
Either we can go with the presentation one or the one which we have pulled it from the Linux tool.

349
00:24:11,107 --> 00:24:15,193
And then we will ask the business to get it, verify and do that.

350
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:21,983
And another thing is because we might be at L3 or even below that because we could be at the application level.

351
00:24:21,963 --> 00:24:26,470
What could be the different applications are there in that L3?

352
00:24:26,951 --> 00:24:30,336
Maybe it's that something outcome that we look for.

353
00:24:30,757 --> 00:24:32,260
I mean, this is what it's coming for.

354
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,363
It is, but that's being mapped separately right now.

355
00:24:34,423 --> 00:24:38,510
That is a separate exercise that's been going on fairly actively right now.

356
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:43,618
I'm actually meeting with, you know, Brian's going to have a communication going out on the application list shortly.

357
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:46,823
Products and applications do not equal.

358
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:52,357
So you could have three applications in a product or you could have one application in a product.

359
00:24:52,417 --> 00:24:53,118
It doesn't matter.

360
00:24:53,178 --> 00:24:56,743
I mean, like if your workday you may say is, okay, HR core is all in workday.

361
00:24:56,763 --> 00:24:57,784
So I have one application.

362
00:24:58,185 --> 00:24:58,986
Good.

363
00:24:59,006 --> 00:24:59,286
Fine.

364
00:24:59,306 --> 00:25:04,813
If you looked at total rewards, total rewards had a dozen applications underneath it.

365
00:25:04,833 --> 00:25:07,997
And it, but they were all vendor managed, but they had a bunch of applications underneath them.

366
00:25:08,438 --> 00:25:10,401
So they're all, but they're all the same product.

367
00:25:10,501 --> 00:25:12,203
They're just different things.

368
00:25:12,672 --> 00:25:15,656
So, you know, it was the CCR one stream conversation.

369
00:25:15,796 --> 00:25:19,421
If a mitt was the one running CCR, it should be CCR.

370
00:25:19,741 --> 00:25:23,666
If a mitt's only running one stream, is one stream the only thing and is there somebody above him?

371
00:25:24,127 --> 00:25:29,353
Now, if there isn't, then maybe they have two different, you know, L3s and that's what they have.

372
00:25:29,453 --> 00:25:33,478
One is one stream, which we would probably call by its name, not by its product name.

373
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:37,043
You know, the software product name.

374
00:25:37,023 --> 00:25:41,307
There's lots of different ways to look at these things, but we are currently working on the application list.

375
00:25:41,327 --> 00:25:45,730
That's something else that's being done, and it's being done as AMP because Brian said it should be done as AMP.

376
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:50,895
Shanti has got something.

377
00:25:50,915 --> 00:25:52,716
We have 12 minutes left.

378
00:25:53,237 --> 00:25:58,501
So my question is, what was the outcome you wanted to achieve on this call?

379
00:25:58,842 --> 00:26:01,244
Because I see outcome for vision session.

380
00:26:01,724 --> 00:26:03,866
What's the vision session?

381
00:26:04,126 --> 00:26:06,388
Who are coming?

382
00:26:06,368 --> 00:26:09,692
Unless there's any other questions specifically to this thing.

383
00:26:10,032 --> 00:26:11,394
Again, this is an informational thing.

384
00:26:11,434 --> 00:26:16,539
If you go with the slide that Chris gave us, it's going to be less hassle, less argument, and it does not going to make really a difference anyway.

385
00:26:16,579 --> 00:26:17,580
So I would just go with that.

386
00:26:18,181 --> 00:26:22,225
But I'm sure we're going to change something, but that's OK.

387
00:26:22,265 --> 00:26:22,846
It doesn't matter.

388
00:26:22,906 --> 00:26:25,009
I mean, like you should go with what Chris's is.

389
00:26:25,309 --> 00:26:30,595
What you really want to know is if they own a function here, no matter what it's called, if we called it 1.1.1, who cares?

390
00:26:32,036 --> 00:26:33,658
What applications they have underneath that?

391
00:26:34,465 --> 00:26:40,674
And if they can say that there's applications under that and we can identify a TPO, that's a positive thing because most of our TPO's are wrong in all of our data.

392
00:26:41,214 --> 00:26:44,599
So that's a huge step forward, so I would go with it.

393
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:49,165
But is there anything else anybody need to know about what the point of capabilities is?

394
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,853
So Carl, yeah, we shall go ahead.

395
00:26:55,954 --> 00:27:03,645
So the intent of the session was we wanted to try and understand how to incorporate lean IX into

396
00:27:04,267 --> 00:27:06,773
the conversation that we're having with limbs tomorrow.

397
00:27:07,254 --> 00:27:16,197
So we have a draft deck that we've created and Prashanti, I'm sharing information and you can opine on what you want us to do with it.

398
00:27:16,598 --> 00:27:20,267
So first question is, when we meet with some kids tomorrow,

399
00:27:21,175 --> 00:27:31,911
We're going to go over the full value mapping, which is the two slides that I think you guys- Can I see the content, please?

400
00:27:31,931 --> 00:27:33,774
I don't want to be assuming.

401
00:27:34,215 --> 00:27:35,436
I want to see the content.

402
00:27:35,456 --> 00:27:38,822
I want to know who is because I don't see anything on my calendar.

403
00:27:39,062 --> 00:27:41,185
So I'm not sure why I'm not invited.

404
00:27:42,507 --> 00:27:49,157
So I want to be there to understand what's going on in the sessions because I don't want another escalation from Sanket.

405
00:27:49,863 --> 00:27:50,364
Correct, correct.

406
00:27:50,384 --> 00:27:57,032
So this is me and Anuj are tagged in, so Rajini, can you forward the session?

407
00:27:57,593 --> 00:28:00,857
So this is the product vision session, right?

408
00:28:00,877 --> 00:28:08,526
So the first thing that we go over is this, I want Temi and Sanke to first understand the full end-to-end picture.

409
00:28:08,967 --> 00:28:12,331
So we're going to go through this slide and this slide, right?

410
00:28:12,551 --> 00:28:14,794
Okay, just one feedback, right there.

411
00:28:14,934 --> 00:28:16,376
Go back to that slide.

412
00:28:16,957 --> 00:28:17,237
Yep.

413
00:28:17,437 --> 00:28:20,764
The first zero needs to have OKRs over there.

414
00:28:20,904 --> 00:28:23,389
Can view OKRs or can you take in data?

415
00:28:23,409 --> 00:28:25,293
I don't want objective and key results.

416
00:28:25,734 --> 00:28:27,558
OKR phrase should come there.

417
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,464
I'll put it in the brackets, whatever.

418
00:28:30,484 --> 00:28:31,887
Can view OKRs?

419
00:28:31,907 --> 00:28:33,991
Is that what you want?

420
00:28:34,011 --> 00:28:36,055
Yeah, can you take in data?

421
00:28:36,075 --> 00:28:38,500
OKRs or whatever.

422
00:28:39,813 --> 00:28:47,302
I want the keyword OKR over there because you have put it in step 2 OKR.

423
00:28:47,703 --> 00:28:51,257
In step 2 you have to put it as product OKRs.

424
00:28:51,642 --> 00:28:55,226
Remember, you all are using language very loosely.

425
00:28:55,266 --> 00:29:02,053
This can have an impact because I sat down with Sarah Yaffe and convinced her, your OKRs are here.

426
00:29:02,153 --> 00:29:03,694
This is our OKRs.

427
00:29:03,714 --> 00:29:06,858
And she was aligned because Sarah Goodman is not convinced.

428
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:14,546
So you need to be very critical because when you're translating into decks, you're losing the feedback that people have given you.

429
00:29:15,246 --> 00:29:15,427
OK.

430
00:29:15,447 --> 00:29:15,547
Sure.

431
00:29:16,027 --> 00:29:16,688
Yeah.

432
00:29:16,708 --> 00:29:18,730
So this is the high level view.

433
00:29:19,705 --> 00:29:25,494
that is being shared tomorrow, which is the first 10, 15 minutes.

434
00:29:25,674 --> 00:29:33,306
Can you please change that to can view OKR on the left, put objective key results in the brackets.

435
00:29:35,569 --> 00:29:40,637
I'm sorry, I am very picky on those things because I'm facing the front of it.

436
00:29:41,979 --> 00:29:47,788
And you can remove the last key, but yeah, OKR, yeah.

437
00:29:49,928 --> 00:29:51,169
So you'll go through this.

438
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:59,079
We're first actually trying to talk about this distinction between SPM and the product model.

439
00:29:59,099 --> 00:30:03,003
So I think this slide should be first, but you tell me if you want to cover it afterward.

440
00:30:03,043 --> 00:30:09,952
I think this is the SPM story, which is, hey, this is where you start, and then this is how you go around in the circle.

441
00:30:09,992 --> 00:30:11,934
This is where we come in, right?

442
00:30:12,014 --> 00:30:14,657
This is where we are coming in with our six steps.

443
00:30:14,697 --> 00:30:18,822
And then this is where we tie the execution and the business value on the metrics and KPI.

444
00:30:18,802 --> 00:30:34,009
So it's basically tying that big picture together that's slide number one slide number two is okay now we'll go into the detailed steps not sessions and steps on how to achieve what we talked about in the previous slide and then I know just go through okay here's

445
00:30:33,989 --> 00:30:36,914
We've kept it very light, right?

446
00:30:36,934 --> 00:30:37,976
We've kept it high level.

447
00:30:38,437 --> 00:30:46,450
Here's what vision means, here's what a vision statement should look like and then we'll go into the workshop saying, okay, here's an example that we gave you for Uber.

448
00:30:46,851 --> 00:30:49,956
We want you to put that workshop and then I want you to put it into Jira.

449
00:30:50,425 --> 00:30:53,909
So then we're going to go into the JIRA structure, that same standard structure.

450
00:30:53,929 --> 00:30:55,290
So let me just go through the slides.

451
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:58,053
I just quickly talked about all this.

452
00:30:58,073 --> 00:31:00,876
So first step is here's the vision.

453
00:31:01,056 --> 00:31:03,758
Two slides on what is the vision, blah, blah, blah.

454
00:31:04,379 --> 00:31:10,866
Next one is you need a vision statement for your product at the product level that has these things captured in it.

455
00:31:10,886 --> 00:31:11,726
Who is it for?

456
00:31:11,887 --> 00:31:13,088
So where is the template?

457
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:14,429
Where will they capture it?

458
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:18,293
The template is over here at the bottom, which is in the last.

459
00:31:18,313 --> 00:31:19,234
What's the template there?

460
00:31:19,805 --> 00:31:20,846
put the template next.

461
00:31:21,467 --> 00:31:26,715
So you said you're going to teach them, this is not a template, this is an example.

462
00:31:26,755 --> 00:31:28,437
Where is the template?

463
00:31:28,457 --> 00:31:32,883
So this is what Anuj is saying that, see we are basically asking them to come up with a template.

464
00:31:32,903 --> 00:31:34,285
I'm just cutting to the chair.

465
00:31:34,425 --> 00:31:35,767
I can share a template.

466
00:31:36,128 --> 00:31:38,191
All I am saying is where is the template?

467
00:31:38,531 --> 00:31:40,394
I need that template in the next slide.

468
00:31:40,434 --> 00:31:46,302
If you're asking them to fill a template, they get a template because this was made clear in the last call

469
00:31:46,282 --> 00:31:50,073
It went against the call with Saakeh and Timi.

470
00:31:50,093 --> 00:31:53,684
Timi just said, give me a template for Shanti.

471
00:31:53,764 --> 00:31:55,369
I'll make him fill the template.

472
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:57,115
And we still are talking.

473
00:31:57,135 --> 00:31:57,897
There's a template.

474
00:31:57,917 --> 00:31:58,659
There's a template.

475
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:00,063
I don't see the template.

476
00:32:00,083 --> 00:32:00,966
Is this a template?

477
00:32:02,195 --> 00:32:03,237
Is this a movie?

478
00:32:03,257 --> 00:32:04,418
I don't think I have access to it.

479
00:32:04,438 --> 00:32:06,241
You might want to look like a template.

480
00:32:06,281 --> 00:32:08,044
This is not how the template looks.

481
00:32:08,064 --> 00:32:13,673
I'm sorry to say a little bit of executiveness that you have to put over here.

482
00:32:13,713 --> 00:32:16,878
If it is who, what, why, how you're just going to randomly put here.

483
00:32:16,898 --> 00:32:20,003
They can send it in a email.

484
00:32:20,624 --> 00:32:26,673
This is the output of the workshop where I think he's going to do the workshop, which is here's what we're going to go through.

485
00:32:26,994 --> 00:32:27,915
Here are the things that

486
00:32:28,098 --> 00:32:34,789
If you are giving it, there should be either a mural board, there should be a template where they're putting sticky notes.

487
00:32:35,169 --> 00:32:36,692
There needs to be something guys.

488
00:32:36,812 --> 00:32:40,498
If you're saying a working session, how will you let them do what?

489
00:32:40,518 --> 00:32:41,460
Who is the scribe?

490
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:49,212
Are you going to open a mural board, put four sections and say, hey, drop in your things over there.

491
00:32:49,529 --> 00:32:50,390
This is the one there.

492
00:32:50,871 --> 00:32:55,279
So this is what screen shot there and say, we are going to capture.

493
00:32:55,319 --> 00:32:58,003
They need to be specific steps.

494
00:32:58,144 --> 00:32:59,446
You will give five minutes.

495
00:32:59,726 --> 00:33:01,289
Have you timed your session?

496
00:33:01,389 --> 00:33:02,972
How much time unusual speak?

497
00:33:03,413 --> 00:33:03,994
When will you?

498
00:33:04,034 --> 00:33:05,817
How much time is this entire thing?

499
00:33:05,837 --> 00:33:07,480
We are going to open up a mural board.

500
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,782
You know, this takes time.

501
00:33:09,363 --> 00:33:11,426
People are thinking people are putting.

502
00:33:11,446 --> 00:33:12,769
They might not put anything.

503
00:33:13,309 --> 00:33:13,630
So.

504
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:24,448
Are you making them do it in the session or are you going to give them one slider template and say, do however you want but put the vision ultimately?

505
00:33:24,708 --> 00:33:25,469
What are you saying?

506
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:34,164
So in this session, Anuj is planning that in this session we will ask, because we are giving them guidance in the session, we are giving them the Uber example.

507
00:33:34,204 --> 00:33:39,853
The goal is that they will use that example to fill out the template.

508
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:41,543
That is the intent.

509
00:33:41,904 --> 00:33:43,789
Let me just, I think I have access to it now.

510
00:33:43,809 --> 00:33:44,351
Thank you.

511
00:33:45,373 --> 00:33:48,242
Oh, I think it's still, it's still working, but whatever.

512
00:33:48,262 --> 00:33:50,247
So you are throwing me this mural board.

513
00:33:50,308 --> 00:33:51,210
What will you tell me?

514
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:51,391
Okay.

515
00:33:51,411 --> 00:33:52,193
I am circuit.

516
00:33:52,594 --> 00:33:53,356
Walk me through it.

517
00:33:54,339 --> 00:33:55,362
What are you asking?

518
00:33:56,236 --> 00:33:57,499
Let's do it right then.

519
00:33:57,619 --> 00:34:00,885
I'm not sure we have this ready.

520
00:34:01,366 --> 00:34:03,571
You don't know how you people are delivering.

521
00:34:04,252 --> 00:34:06,015
You all are scrambling with me.

522
00:34:06,456 --> 00:34:11,266
One of you showing the mural board, one of you showing the appendix slide.

523
00:34:11,566 --> 00:34:12,809
You don't have a game plan.

524
00:34:12,829 --> 00:34:13,350
Sorry.

525
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:36,402
you don't none of you have a game plan you have no strategy how you're going to go there you have no strategy how will you ask them to okay you're you're doing a session what will be the output you're saying jeera vishal i see a mural board who is doing what by doing the session i'm doing the opening right i'm doing the opening where i'm giving the big picture

526
00:34:36,668 --> 00:34:40,531
and then Anuj is going to walk through the first few slides with the examples.

527
00:34:40,592 --> 00:34:43,334
So my story is I'm going to do the opening.

528
00:34:43,574 --> 00:34:45,516
How much time is this session?

529
00:34:45,536 --> 00:34:46,297
I'm doing 10 minutes.

530
00:34:46,337 --> 00:34:48,499
Anuj is doing 50, a 60-minute session.

531
00:34:49,059 --> 00:34:54,184
Out of the 50 minutes, Anuj is going to take the first 10, 15 minutes to talk.

532
00:34:54,544 --> 00:34:55,945
Hold on, hold on.

533
00:34:56,366 --> 00:34:59,288
10 minutes you are done, you will cover your three slides.

534
00:34:59,308 --> 00:35:04,573
50 minutes he's doing this workshop, but you were talking about mapping.

535
00:35:04,593 --> 00:35:06,675
Where is the mapping part of it?

536
00:35:06,655 --> 00:35:09,201
asking them to map.

537
00:35:09,702 --> 00:35:23,753
So the theory part is so the next 15, 20 minutes, right, which is the first half hour of the session, we're going to cover the theory, right, which is this is how you do it, which 30 minutes over in the next 30 minutes, what is the industry exactly.

538
00:35:26,028 --> 00:35:33,419
session and which is going to give the example so that they can start thinking about, hey, look, let's use the Uber example to talk about this who, what, why, what.

539
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:41,050
Now apply this to your product, and that's where we are introducing the Miro board, which is over here, which is the workshop agenda.

540
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:43,433
This is the 30 minute workshop.

541
00:35:43,453 --> 00:35:45,035
Now, when- Where is the mapping?

542
00:35:45,316 --> 00:35:48,981
Where are you asking them to map?

543
00:35:50,075 --> 00:35:51,658
mapping it back into Jira, right?

544
00:35:51,678 --> 00:35:52,460
That's what you're asking.

545
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,963
Is that what you want to know?

546
00:35:53,983 --> 00:35:55,726
You said Jira, that is one thing.

547
00:35:55,806 --> 00:35:59,854
What about we are talking about all these L2T, all these things?

548
00:35:59,875 --> 00:36:01,458
Where is that?

549
00:36:01,578 --> 00:36:05,205
So that is the part that we were trying to understand today.

550
00:36:05,225 --> 00:36:08,151
No, but one number is over, right?

551
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:13,397
One day, we are not even 24 hours away from the session.

552
00:36:13,417 --> 00:36:15,500
I don't see a skeleton.

553
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,725
I don't see which slide is getting delivered by whom.

554
00:36:19,066 --> 00:36:21,570
I don't see how much time we are reserving for work.

555
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:23,032
I see something over here.

556
00:36:23,052 --> 00:36:24,755
45 minutes discussion.

557
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:25,836
I'm synthesized.

558
00:36:26,958 --> 00:36:28,941
Why should they be even doing it?

559
00:36:29,157 --> 00:36:31,700
Along with you, I don't understand these visions.

560
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:37,607
You're not giving them capabilities to say, hey, map your vision to capabilities.

561
00:36:37,627 --> 00:36:38,468
You are not.

562
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:45,156
And there was a better slide, a better template of a vision where it had a couple of boxes over there.

563
00:36:45,176 --> 00:36:46,958
What is the purpose of the product?

564
00:36:46,978 --> 00:36:47,999
What is this?

565
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:51,763
That would automatically give you an end to capability.

566
00:36:51,783 --> 00:36:55,047
Because if a circuit says, what's the purpose of lens,

567
00:36:55,027 --> 00:36:59,575
Even we might be able to map it to L2, but now you're not asking anything.

568
00:36:59,655 --> 00:37:11,416
Just simply putting why, what, when, they're going to give you one line sentences and that will become your vision statement because they are saying, give me a perfect template.

569
00:37:11,836 --> 00:37:13,078
I will fill it over there.

570
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:17,406
So if you have all these questions, which applications you map to, which

571
00:37:17,386 --> 00:37:23,872
there should be a place in the template which asks for those questions.

572
00:37:24,292 --> 00:37:27,896
If you don't ask for those questions, they're not going to answer your question.

573
00:37:28,316 --> 00:37:28,777
Got it.

574
00:37:29,097 --> 00:37:36,744
So Carl, can you give me that word document that you extracted out of Lean IX where you have the L1, L2, whatever, the other products?

575
00:37:37,044 --> 00:37:44,271
If you can just send me that, I'll create a slide that says at the output of this session, these are the things that we want for links.

576
00:37:44,909 --> 00:37:50,319
No, your template will not even be influenced by what he's giving.

577
00:37:50,619 --> 00:37:53,464
He can give ABCX, YZ, Vishal.

578
00:37:53,825 --> 00:37:55,809
Where is my vision template?

579
00:37:55,829 --> 00:38:09,313
I'm simply asking all of you guys, where is my vision template which says, hey, there needs to be a question for what are the A2 capabilities, your mapping, who is your sponsor, who is your stakeholders, who is your leader.

580
00:38:09,293 --> 00:38:11,476
That's all thing is vision.

581
00:38:11,616 --> 00:38:14,501
You're all so focused on piecemealing it.

582
00:38:15,242 --> 00:38:20,950
Vision is just what the product... No, as a part of the vision, I want to know all these outlying things.

583
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:22,132
Who is your product owner?

584
00:38:22,252 --> 00:38:23,153
Business owner?

585
00:38:23,554 --> 00:38:25,036
All these things need to be answered.

586
00:38:25,056 --> 00:38:27,439
This is your one shot you're getting with them.

587
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:31,826
In one hour, ask them to fill all the missing information.

588
00:38:31,846 --> 00:38:33,709
You people told me, we don't know teams.

589
00:38:33,809 --> 00:38:34,710
We don't know.

590
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:36,033
Put all those boxes.

591
00:38:36,053 --> 00:38:44,674
There needs to be a pretty template, like a project charter template, a project, a vision template should be there, which is very prescriptive.

592
00:38:44,694 --> 00:38:46,078
You don't have to narrate it.

593
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:51,130
Any person should read and be, who is your business partner?

594
00:38:51,818 --> 00:38:53,861
Sake should be just simply able to fill it.

595
00:38:53,961 --> 00:38:57,505
You don't have to teach him who is a business partner, right?

596
00:38:57,765 --> 00:39:02,231
Do you know who the... Sake always keeps saying, hey, I work with my business.

597
00:39:02,431 --> 00:39:03,452
I do whatever he says.

598
00:39:03,853 --> 00:39:06,656
Do we know who that person is referring to?

599
00:39:07,177 --> 00:39:09,881
Does it take requirements from 10 people, one person?

600
00:39:10,581 --> 00:39:11,903
Do we know that?

601
00:39:13,047 --> 00:39:16,636
If you know it, pre-populate it.

602
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:26,061
If you're saying that you want a template for all six of this, we can just create that and share it with them tomorrow.

603
00:39:27,408 --> 00:39:28,129
We can do that.

604
00:39:28,149 --> 00:39:34,500
We can give them saying, here's a template for vision, here's a template for product.

605
00:39:35,242 --> 00:39:37,786
We have been talking about this for three months now.

606
00:39:38,347 --> 00:39:42,194
And what Anuj promised me was for every workshop there's a template.

607
00:39:42,214 --> 00:39:43,476
And I don't see a template.

608
00:39:43,496 --> 00:39:44,117
I'm sorry.

609
00:39:44,177 --> 00:39:45,159
I'm losing it.

610
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:49,987
Either you tell me, Vishanti, you do it, create a template.

611
00:39:50,007 --> 00:39:51,370
I'll come and create the template.

612
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:52,251
I'll deliver the template.

613
00:39:53,378 --> 00:39:59,348
But I'm not saying we're always talking, hey, this could be one way, that could be one way.

614
00:39:59,508 --> 00:40:07,862
Some one way we need, whether we like the template or not, whoever is asking the questions, you need to put that question there so that we get the answers.

615
00:40:08,323 --> 00:40:11,168
At the end of the day, I'm really afraid, guys.

616
00:40:11,148 --> 00:40:13,411
We will just get four sentences.

617
00:40:13,992 --> 00:40:14,713
What is this?

618
00:40:14,733 --> 00:40:18,299
He'll say, it's a lab management system that will be answered.

619
00:40:18,399 --> 00:40:19,681
I know circuits very well.

620
00:40:21,023 --> 00:40:23,827
Then he will say, hey, why do we need it?

621
00:40:23,987 --> 00:40:25,830
He'll say, it's a GHP thing.

622
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:26,290
I know.

623
00:40:26,551 --> 00:40:27,933
It's a TQ process.

624
00:40:27,993 --> 00:40:29,095
We cannot miss it.

625
00:40:29,155 --> 00:40:31,538
He's going to give crappy answers, believe me.

626
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,062
Then you will say, I don't know.

627
00:40:34,142 --> 00:40:34,843
Why what?

628
00:40:34,983 --> 00:40:35,264
Who?

629
00:40:35,324 --> 00:40:35,765
I don't know.

630
00:40:36,125 --> 00:40:38,809
He'll just give you one line sentences.

631
00:40:38,789 --> 00:40:43,014
And he'll challenge you, this is what is the template I have answered your questions.

632
00:40:43,154 --> 00:40:44,476
Rajini, you know him better.

633
00:40:44,516 --> 00:40:48,981
You go with those four answers, you're going to get four sentences.

634
00:40:51,604 --> 00:40:55,368
And he's only started, that's why I want to know the participants, who is there?

635
00:40:55,729 --> 00:41:01,135
Even if you open a mural board, there will be one, one sticky that he'll place it.

636
00:41:02,735 --> 00:41:03,678
Who all are coming?

637
00:41:03,698 --> 00:41:04,501
Is Timmy coming?

638
00:41:04,521 --> 00:41:05,925
Is Smith coming?

639
00:41:06,086 --> 00:41:08,052
Who are the best partners?

640
00:41:08,072 --> 00:41:09,236
The best three people.

641
00:41:09,256 --> 00:41:10,299
He told only three are enough.

642
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:12,205
Timmy, Smith and himself.

643
00:41:13,906 --> 00:41:18,190
So only three people are coming and I asked him, like, do you want to, you know, forward the invite to anybody?

644
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:20,112
So Chris Smith will laugh at this template.

645
00:41:20,152 --> 00:41:22,154
If you say, why, what, it's full.

646
00:41:22,534 --> 00:41:25,417
He'll say, he's just, then he's going to challenge me.

647
00:41:25,457 --> 00:41:29,441
Hold on, hold on, Rajini.

648
00:41:29,861 --> 00:41:35,106
Now the conversation I know once, because Timney yesterday you, you heard Rajini, you were there, right?

649
00:41:35,207 --> 00:41:37,389
Well, he said, Prashanti, give me a template.

650
00:41:37,569 --> 00:41:38,470
I'll populate it.

651
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:40,892
Then my, will my maturity go up?

652
00:41:41,851 --> 00:41:43,053
That was his question.

653
00:41:43,293 --> 00:41:46,357
I say your maturity won't go up, but we'll give you a template.

654
00:41:46,738 --> 00:41:48,040
And this is not a template.

655
00:41:50,743 --> 00:41:52,506
Who can come back to me with a template?

656
00:41:52,666 --> 00:41:56,311
If I don't get a template, at what time is the session?

657
00:41:56,371 --> 00:41:57,453
Tomorrow noon.

658
00:41:58,054 --> 00:41:59,356
Tomorrow at noon.

659
00:42:01,699 --> 00:42:04,743
But we'll actually have the invite.

660
00:42:06,245 --> 00:42:09,630
But what we'll do is, today I think we need to have

661
00:42:10,741 --> 00:42:13,987
I think I understand where you are going with this question.

662
00:42:14,007 --> 00:42:16,091
I think everybody understands where you're going with this, right?

663
00:42:16,111 --> 00:42:19,938
Which is, if I get one hour with you, I'm going to give you everything that I need.

664
00:42:20,298 --> 00:42:22,783
I can tell you what the CanVue target and OKR is.

665
00:42:23,504 --> 00:42:25,688
I need your product line vision.

666
00:42:25,969 --> 00:42:31,078
I need your product group OKRs, product OKRs for Lin specifically.

667
00:42:31,058 --> 00:42:34,141
And we'll give them like one or two slides, one slide.

668
00:42:34,281 --> 00:42:37,364
And one more question is, we need Chris Serito there.

669
00:42:37,724 --> 00:42:41,868
If we are talking about Lee and IH and all, why is Chris missing?

670
00:42:42,368 --> 00:42:43,669
Why is Ruchir missing?

671
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:49,895
Or at least Ruchir should have been there as Chris's delegate, right?

672
00:42:50,075 --> 00:42:52,718
He is going to support you on those product vision.

673
00:42:52,738 --> 00:42:59,564
Whatever, if Chris says, hey, this is not the L2 capabilities, Ruchir has to support you and say, this is the L2 capabilities.

674
00:42:59,604 --> 00:43:01,065
Why is he missing?

675
00:43:01,045 --> 00:43:02,768
These are the people.

676
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:04,431
You need to think about the audience.

677
00:43:04,672 --> 00:43:08,579
As we are changing the scope, we need to get the right audience there.

678
00:43:08,679 --> 00:43:11,665
If Chris cannot be there, who is the next best person?

679
00:43:11,705 --> 00:43:12,066
Ruchit.

680
00:43:12,386 --> 00:43:16,093
If Ruchit cannot be there, we still make them optional and go forwards.

681
00:43:16,454 --> 00:43:21,383
Because unless we bring Chris and Chris Smith, Chris Serito and Chris Smith,

682
00:43:21,363 --> 00:43:23,306
They will never come into an alignment.

683
00:43:23,346 --> 00:43:30,395
We need to bring them, do a face-off and say, hey, you people fight it out and tell me, come out of this session with one.

684
00:43:31,076 --> 00:43:32,638
That's our victory, right?

685
00:43:32,698 --> 00:43:34,480
Because we are running with two things.

686
00:43:35,041 --> 00:43:37,144
Make them meet and talk in that session.

687
00:43:37,184 --> 00:43:38,886
They might quarrel.

688
00:43:39,006 --> 00:43:39,527
It's okay.

689
00:43:40,068 --> 00:43:41,350
Mediate that discussion.

690
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:49,300
And when you come out of that discussion, we should have one list or aligned list where we know Chris Smith and Chris Cerrito agrees.

691
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:50,762
That is a victory.

692
00:43:50,742 --> 00:43:54,827
I want to define what is success of our thing.

693
00:43:54,847 --> 00:44:03,977
We can just give this course and come out and we can be again talking about there are two lists or any of the problem and say there is one list right now.

694
00:44:04,158 --> 00:44:07,121
Because what does Brian Radisab is going to go and do?

695
00:44:07,221 --> 00:44:09,704
He'll have a separate conversation with Chris Serito.

696
00:44:09,724 --> 00:44:10,665
He'll have a separate one.

697
00:44:10,946 --> 00:44:11,326
No.

698
00:44:12,167 --> 00:44:13,609
Now rubber hits the road.

699
00:44:14,209 --> 00:44:16,692
Why are we catching a capability list to the vision?

700
00:44:17,133 --> 00:44:19,095
Why are we not trying to get the vision right?

701
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:22,388
We're not.

702
00:44:24,272 --> 00:44:31,606
The goal was to try and get as much as possible in one session instead of having multiple sessions, but we don't have to.

703
00:44:31,847 --> 00:44:38,400
I understand that, but I don't think that we're ready to go and say which one of these things do you map up to if this stuff is still being debated and being reviewed.

704
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,786
But I heard there was already an alignment.

705
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:45,929
That's how it went into linearity.

706
00:44:45,949 --> 00:44:50,496
So I just want to remind Chris Matt, this is already aligned and accepted.

707
00:44:50,516 --> 00:44:52,299
So why are you changing the structure?

708
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:55,143
I want a second objective to come up.

709
00:44:55,163 --> 00:44:57,086
We have all the right people in the room.

710
00:44:57,167 --> 00:45:01,333
Why are we hesitating to ask the right questions?

711
00:45:01,313 --> 00:45:05,241
Because we know it's a lingering problem, can we fix the lingering issue?

712
00:45:05,962 --> 00:45:09,810
You're trying to fix Chris Cerudo's problem with the product model.

713
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:15,482
And by doing that, you're going to have an issue, I mean, you need them to have a vision statement.

714
00:45:15,762 --> 00:45:19,069
The success for the product model is they have the vision statement.

715
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:29,086
How can a vision statement be drafted without knowing what capability they are supporting?

716
00:45:29,106 --> 00:45:30,609
Because that's the purpose, right?

717
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:35,978
In reality, they should be able to say, I am going to support this

718
00:45:35,958 --> 00:45:39,523
Well, yes and no.

719
00:45:39,543 --> 00:45:41,085
We've already made the decision.

720
00:45:41,265 --> 00:45:44,330
If we made the decision to go from the bottom up, it doesn't matter nearly as much.

721
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:45,711
They know what they're targeting.

722
00:45:46,272 --> 00:45:55,685
If you're going to say that the vision statement is going to be done the right way, then we would have started with L1s and we would have gotten them to give us one that would have been used for L2s.

723
00:45:55,725 --> 00:45:56,827
It would have been used for L3s.

724
00:45:57,147 --> 00:45:58,309
We're starting at L3s.

725
00:45:58,729 --> 00:46:03,636
So what we really have is the success is that they come out with a vision statement.

726
00:46:05,185 --> 00:46:11,671
Sorry, I have to go, but you guys know brainstorm it, but I need a template.

727
00:46:12,012 --> 00:46:14,334
I need a format, how we are going through.

728
00:46:14,854 --> 00:46:19,419
I'm going to do some offline conversation.

729
00:46:19,519 --> 00:46:22,602
I'm trying to bring Chris Smith and Chris Ferrito together.

730
00:46:22,642 --> 00:46:28,728
Whether in that call or a separate, let me get back to you how that goes.

731
00:46:28,748 --> 00:46:30,670
For now, I need to know.

732
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:33,633
In respect, forget which capability metrics.

733
00:46:33,653 --> 00:46:39,880
At least we all agree that a product should support a capability.

734
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:44,606
Wherever it is, however it is, they should support some R&D capability.

735
00:46:45,186 --> 00:46:51,413
As long as they can articulate that in their own words, then we can match that capability in our taxonomy.

736
00:46:51,434 --> 00:46:57,180
But they need to be able to say, this product delivers some capability.

737
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:05,463
If that can be there in that vision template, that is what I'm looking towards.

738
00:47:05,744 --> 00:47:08,130
And then we will see how to map that.

739
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:11,760
But they need to say which business capable.
