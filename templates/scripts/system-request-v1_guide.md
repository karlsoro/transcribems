# System/Feature Request Recording Guide

**Template:** System/Feature Request
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Purpose
This guide helps you record a comprehensive feature request that can be automatically formatted into a spec-kit compatible document.

## Required Information

### 1. Feature Name
- Provide a clear, concise title for the feature
- Example: "User Authentication with OAuth2"

### 2. Problem Statement
- What problem are you solving?
- Who is experiencing this problem?
- What is the impact of not solving it?

### 3. Target Users
- Who will use this feature?
- What are their roles?
- What are their skill levels?

### 4. Proposed Solution
- High-level description of your approach
- Key components or changes needed
- How it solves the problem

### 5. Acceptance Criteria
- How will you know the feature is complete?
- What are the specific conditions that must be met?
- List at least 3-5 testable criteria

### 6. Technical Constraints
- Any limitations or requirements?
- Performance considerations?
- Compatibility requirements?
- Security requirements?

### 7. Dependencies
- What other features/systems does this depend on?
- What existing functionality will be affected?
- Are there any prerequisites?

### 8. Priority
- Business urgency: High, Medium, Low
- Why is this priority level appropriate?

## Recording Tips

1. **Speak Clearly**: Articulate each section clearly
2. **Use Structure**: Explicitly state which section you're addressing
   - Example: "For the problem statement..."
3. **Provide Examples**: Use specific scenarios and examples
4. **Think Through Edge Cases**: Mention error scenarios and edge cases
5. **Be Specific**: Avoid vague language like "better" or "improved"
6. **Include Numbers**: Mention specific metrics or requirements

## Sample Script

> "I'd like to request a new feature for user authentication using OAuth2.
>
> For the problem statement: Currently, users must create and remember separate credentials for our application. This creates friction in the onboarding process and leads to support tickets about password resets. Studies show we lose 30% of potential users at the registration step.
>
> The target users are all application users, particularly non-technical business users who prefer using their existing corporate credentials.
>
> For the proposed solution: Integrate OAuth2 authentication supporting Microsoft Azure AD and Google Workspace. This will allow users to sign in with their existing corporate accounts. We'll maintain backward compatibility with existing username/password authentication.
>
> For acceptance criteria:
> - Users can click "Sign in with Microsoft" or "Sign in with Google"
> - Authentication redirects to the appropriate provider
> - User profile is created automatically on first login
> - Existing users can link their OAuth2 accounts to their existing profiles
> - The system logs all authentication attempts for security auditing
>
> Technical constraints include: Must comply with SOC2 requirements, must work with our existing JWT token system, and must support MFA if the OAuth provider requires it.
>
> Dependencies: This depends on the user profile service and the session management system being updated to handle OAuth tokens.
>
> Priority is high because reducing onboarding friction is a key business objective for Q1."

## After Recording

1. Review the transcript to ensure all sections are covered
2. Use the formatting tool to generate the spec-kit document
3. Review validation warnings and add any missing information
4. Download the formatted document

## Questions?

If you're unsure what information to provide for any section, make a note during recording and add it later when reviewing the formatted output.
