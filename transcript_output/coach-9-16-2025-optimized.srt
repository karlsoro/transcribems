1
00:00:03,641 --> 00:00:04,863
Okay.

2
00:00:11,352 --> 00:00:17,981
Maybe let's give one more minute for Vishal to join in, then they get started.

3
00:00:18,742 --> 00:00:25,751
So today we wanted to talk about, okay it is Satish who has joined, okay.

4
00:00:26,356 --> 00:00:39,218
We wanted to talk about the taxonomy and after that we also wanted to touch upon what are the outcomes that we are planning to achieve.

5
00:00:39,686 --> 00:00:41,268
by end of the vision statement.

6
00:00:41,829 --> 00:00:53,703
There was a discussion, there's a thought Pashanti has shared that whether she's looking for three things, one is the vision statement, then two or three capabilities and the mapping to the respective application.

7
00:00:53,942 --> 00:01:02,353
So that's the three things, but then here is the first step like building that the standing and modifying the content for the vision works up tomorrow.

8
00:01:02,332 --> 00:01:05,099
Accordingly, that's the plan.

9
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:09,188
So Karl, I think we have full house, which may not be able to join.

10
00:01:09,248 --> 00:01:10,793
He has some medical emergency.

11
00:01:11,334 --> 00:01:12,256
That's what he's sure.

12
00:01:12,396 --> 00:01:15,263
So we can get started.

13
00:01:15,596 --> 00:01:17,540
What do you get all yours?

14
00:01:17,561 --> 00:01:18,522
Yeah, sure.

15
00:01:18,543 --> 00:01:24,935
I mean, and a lot of what we were covering was I mean, seems to be that there's people don't know what a business capability is or how business capability maps are.

16
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:29,944
I'm not looking at what our business capability map is because there's still some stuff up in the air there.

17
00:01:30,064 --> 00:01:34,433
We had some conversation over last couple days of

18
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:46,402
There is a version in Lean IX, which currently is considered the, you know, the Kenview version, but there's also some discussion about whether or not the Lean IX version is right or not, so we'll continue to have those discussions.

19
00:01:47,123 --> 00:01:52,509
But my bigger thing is understanding what a business capability map and how it works into the product model.

20
00:01:52,569 --> 00:01:55,371
What does a business capability map have to do with a product model?

21
00:01:56,132 --> 00:01:58,796
They are very, very much linked.

22
00:01:59,417 --> 00:02:04,302
And by definition, if you look at the design of a product model by anybody,

23
00:02:05,242 --> 00:02:08,306
Actually, I was just looking yesterday at seven different product models.

24
00:02:08,665 --> 00:02:09,586
There's seven different versions.

25
00:02:09,627 --> 00:02:13,830
The product model that I've been able to locate over the seven, every single one of them uses.

26
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:19,254
I'm sorry, I just got it.

27
00:02:19,275 --> 00:02:21,676
You know, I guess I'm the being that you have to pay attention to.

28
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:30,685
The, you know, in the product model, what they're doing in a lot of cases is what you're doing exactly what we're looking at.

29
00:02:30,705 --> 00:02:33,747
When you're talking about a line to a group,

30
00:02:34,167 --> 00:02:38,092
to a team, you're looking at capabilities.

31
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:46,444
A line is a high level, a level one capability, a product group is a level two capability, and a level three capability is a team.

32
00:02:47,025 --> 00:02:48,647
That's why they're defined the way they are.

33
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:52,293
We had a definition that was used to category software.

34
00:02:52,753 --> 00:02:57,741
We're changing from that definition, we're moving out of that definition, there's a Copa version that was used there.

35
00:02:58,161 --> 00:03:00,764
Copa is a standards organization.

36
00:03:00,745 --> 00:03:05,012
The standards organization of the CPG business is what it's from.

37
00:03:05,893 --> 00:03:06,713
We won't be using that one.

38
00:03:06,814 --> 00:03:08,056
There are some changes from there.

39
00:03:09,318 --> 00:03:12,282
There's a couple other models that are out there that are fairly common.

40
00:03:12,843 --> 00:03:19,234
About five of them is the same model, but for the most part, there's different models.

41
00:03:19,675 --> 00:03:27,967
So I'm intentionally going to use a graphic from an I will share in this condition as I find it.

42
00:03:28,133 --> 00:03:30,656
A graphic that's, this is how it looks.

43
00:03:30,675 --> 00:03:31,616
This isn't ours.

44
00:03:32,418 --> 00:03:33,598
It has nothing to do with ours.

45
00:03:33,758 --> 00:03:36,141
I don't want to use ours for a very good reason.

46
00:03:36,262 --> 00:03:41,168
Is that ours is up in the air and I don't want people to get confused by what's going to be there.

47
00:03:42,909 --> 00:03:48,175
So if I can just find this stupid thing, I will share it.

48
00:03:50,679 --> 00:03:51,459
All right, where did it go?

49
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:56,205
That's not the one.

50
00:03:56,685 --> 00:03:58,106
That is ours, okay.

51
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:03,915
And I am working currently on as part of another process.

52
00:04:04,075 --> 00:04:06,459
I'm working on what ours will look like.

53
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:16,189
Somewhat I need to get agreement from a couple people before I can say so, because whether we're gonna have one or two and things like that, because there's a lot of different thought processes out there.

54
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,432
So, where did it go?

55
00:04:20,274 --> 00:04:20,954
There it is, okay.

56
00:04:22,115 --> 00:04:23,137
Now I have to go back to sharing.

57
00:04:23,757 --> 00:04:25,360
I have to find it before I get shared.

58
00:04:27,887 --> 00:04:46,625
The fun of working on a Mac is you have multiple screens and I can't find the stupid thing on the screen.

59
00:04:46,665 --> 00:04:47,286
I want it to be on.

60
00:04:48,507 --> 00:04:50,529
All right, I'll open it again.

61
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:52,651
I can't show it.

62
00:04:52,672 --> 00:04:54,012
All right, let me try this.

63
00:04:54,331 --> 00:04:56,858
if I can share my entire thing just because it's easier that way.

64
00:04:58,723 --> 00:05:02,574
And then you can tell me whether or not you can see it when I get it where to go.

65
00:05:03,677 --> 00:05:05,100
All right, if I share my screen, can you see that?

66
00:05:05,461 --> 00:05:06,966
Are you seeing a big box?

67
00:05:06,985 --> 00:05:07,988
Okay, good.

68
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:08,932
Cool.

69
00:05:08,951 --> 00:05:10,095
All right, now.

70
00:05:10,312 --> 00:05:13,718
When I talk about L1s, then this is where you'll start to see where things happen.

71
00:05:13,738 --> 00:05:18,949
When you talk about L1s, where you see operating processes here, or management and support processes.

72
00:05:19,309 --> 00:05:20,151
Those are L1s.

73
00:05:20,531 --> 00:05:29,449
Those usually have a VP over them at a VP level that would be responsible for operating processes and what the goals are for that operating processes group.

74
00:05:30,209 --> 00:05:32,134
So if we were to look at

75
00:05:32,435 --> 00:05:33,896
Probably Eleanor is the best mix.

76
00:05:34,057 --> 00:05:44,613
Eleanor in our company has enterprise services, which includes corporate services, and it includes supply chain, which is sometimes done, sometimes not.

77
00:05:44,673 --> 00:05:45,776
It's a little unique on its own.

78
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:53,228
But what comes in after that, normally, would then be, where do you take the things that are inside of

79
00:05:53,596 --> 00:05:54,437
enterprise services.

80
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:56,382
So enterprise services has a lot of different systems.

81
00:05:57,105 --> 00:05:59,692
Okay, we have a lot of different things but they're grouped together.

82
00:05:59,771 --> 00:06:02,559
So maybe we were to say is I'm going to do corporate systems.

83
00:06:04,384 --> 00:06:07,692
Now the thing that gets lost quite often is you can have multiple capabilities under there.

84
00:06:07,732 --> 00:06:10,338
So you might say corporate systems is one of these boxes.

85
00:06:12,057 --> 00:06:13,379
Well, what do we have in corporate systems?

86
00:06:14,101 --> 00:06:16,769
Well, we can have finance systems, we can have HR systems.

87
00:06:16,829 --> 00:06:18,213
But what is the capability?

88
00:06:18,273 --> 00:06:19,014
What are they doing?

89
00:06:19,596 --> 00:06:27,956
So if I were to look at HR and say, what are the actual capabilities that would make up these blue boxes in this case,

90
00:06:27,937 --> 00:06:33,163
I would look at things like if I said I was in corporate systems and I had capabilities inside corporate systems.

91
00:06:33,204 --> 00:06:36,908
Now, HR can be grouped in there as its own or as something different.

92
00:06:37,007 --> 00:06:38,670
You could make HR one of these boxes.

93
00:06:39,672 --> 00:06:40,552
People do it different ways.

94
00:06:40,812 --> 00:06:44,978
So if we were to say HR was one of these yellow blocks, HR has capabilities.

95
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,141
You have Core HCM, which is things like Workday.

96
00:06:48,983 --> 00:06:52,807
You have compensations, which could be in total reward.

97
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,812
You could have

98
00:06:58,884 --> 00:07:02,454
talent recruiting which is another part of all of that.

99
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:11,274
Now those would normally have a leader in the yellow box in that case would be Jessica in our case because we've dealt with Jessica and the blue box is what you would see is the

100
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:13,795
folks that we're working with and I can't remember what her name is.

101
00:07:14,214 --> 00:07:15,598
Generally, you would actually be somebody more.

102
00:07:15,757 --> 00:07:18,802
Now, we have an extra layer in the corporate end of the world.

103
00:07:19,204 --> 00:07:20,605
So we do have extra people in there.

104
00:07:21,226 --> 00:07:24,913
But if we were to split off HR on its own, we wouldn't.

105
00:07:24,952 --> 00:07:28,057
If we said HR or compensation is that, then you'd have just owning two boxes.

106
00:07:28,678 --> 00:07:29,880
That's why it gets confused.

107
00:07:30,322 --> 00:07:37,954
But what we're trying to do is say is what I need to know is what are my high level lines so that I have a leader here that's a

108
00:07:38,372 --> 00:07:41,317
aligning with that business side of that.

109
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:43,600
These don't just apply to technology.

110
00:07:43,641 --> 00:07:45,083
They apply to technology and business.

111
00:07:45,963 --> 00:07:54,016
So if I were to be able to apply both of them and say, okay, in the business, we have a set of goals.

112
00:07:54,156 --> 00:07:55,718
Those goals come cascading down.

113
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:01,326
When we talk about cost savings, maybe at operating process, we want to save

114
00:08:03,095 --> 00:08:07,242
$50 million and we have six boxes here.

115
00:08:07,762 --> 00:08:18,502
We may split that six boxes into six parts and say you each have to do one or we may do it unevenly because they're of the impact each group has.

116
00:08:18,521 --> 00:08:21,408
You would then cascade that would be where that cascaded goal would come from.

117
00:08:21,487 --> 00:08:26,757
So if the vision of operating processes is to shorten work times and reduce costs,

118
00:08:27,461 --> 00:08:29,324
OK, that vision is going to cascade down.

119
00:08:29,803 --> 00:08:32,566
It's going to cascade down to the things what impact they can have.

120
00:08:33,086 --> 00:08:38,171
Then those will get down to the team level to say which individual team should be supporting in what level.

121
00:08:38,631 --> 00:08:40,092
So the goal doesn't change.

122
00:08:40,913 --> 00:08:45,116
The portion of the goal that the teams can actually impact changes.

123
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,460
So that's when you're looking at your vision.

124
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,660
The vision doesn't change.

125
00:08:49,761 --> 00:08:54,024
The vision becomes specified much more detailed to what you can do.

126
00:08:54,946 --> 00:08:57,148
So if they say, yeah, right.

127
00:08:58,005 --> 00:09:00,327
question for you.

128
00:09:00,347 --> 00:09:09,836
Can we say that this is a guideline for teams to define what the L1 capabilities are?

129
00:09:11,697 --> 00:09:14,620
Yes, not sure, but L2.

130
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,024
Well, L1 is a product line.

131
00:09:18,864 --> 00:09:22,927
Teams wouldn't define what their product line is.

132
00:09:23,648 --> 00:09:27,692
Corporate systems would, like if you were going into, who's going first?

133
00:09:28,465 --> 00:09:29,885
Who's going tomorrow?

134
00:09:31,847 --> 00:09:38,674
We're doing plans.

135
00:09:38,955 --> 00:09:48,303
Okay, so you may be looking at research and development as being the product line, which is probably, it may or may not be part of operations, but that's okay.

136
00:09:48,323 --> 00:09:56,532
So let's assume that R&D was this thing, rather than operating processes, this said research and development, and you were going into the lab services.

137
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,006
There could be two teams, there could be three teams, there could be multiple software packages.

138
00:10:01,508 --> 00:10:11,148
So their L1 would then be R&D, their L2 would be lab services, and their individual teams, limbs being one of them would be an L3.

139
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:18,283
So then the level three capability is lab, I forget what limbs does now, monitoring and notebooking it.

140
00:10:19,342 --> 00:10:27,551
So how do I translate this into business capabilities that I'm going to maybe just need?

141
00:10:27,571 --> 00:10:33,076
Well, again, this is where we run into the problem here at Kenview because we haven't really settled on something.

142
00:10:33,096 --> 00:10:38,360
There are industry definitions that say, this is the capabilities that you do in the company.

143
00:10:39,081 --> 00:10:41,803
We can use those or we can use what they define.

144
00:10:41,923 --> 00:10:46,227
If they want to call limbs, I am the lab management platforms.

145
00:10:46,697 --> 00:10:48,280
OK, your lab management platforms.

146
00:10:48,301 --> 00:10:49,403
Do you have any more than one system?

147
00:10:49,623 --> 00:10:50,024
Maybe not.

148
00:10:50,485 --> 00:10:51,427
It's possible they don't.

149
00:10:52,128 --> 00:10:54,032
It could be their lab management platforms.

150
00:10:54,072 --> 00:11:00,003
Then their blue box would say lab management platforms, which is fine.

151
00:11:00,062 --> 00:11:03,148
I mean, they can define whatever they want to put there.

152
00:11:03,389 --> 00:11:10,562
The problem I think we have right now is that we have multiple places where we've already gathered this information multiple times.

153
00:11:10,863 --> 00:11:12,264
and everybody's getting different answers.

154
00:11:12,966 --> 00:11:17,333
So we have to figure out who is the source of truth or what is the source of truth and stick to one.

155
00:11:17,955 --> 00:11:21,301
So right now what I'm using is what actually happens to be in lean IX.

156
00:11:22,283 --> 00:11:28,153
So if I were to look at what's in lean IX, lean IX has a set of things.

157
00:11:28,192 --> 00:11:28,975
Let me see if I can find it.

158
00:11:29,134 --> 00:11:30,998
I could probably can because I think I had it open.

159
00:11:31,956 --> 00:11:36,672
Pishanti has a question, I think she just tempts out as well.

160
00:11:36,692 --> 00:11:44,177
So what I understood here is the L1 is kind of equivalent to the product line.

161
00:11:44,798 --> 00:11:49,581
That's what we are seeing it, which particularly talks about what your product does.

162
00:11:50,462 --> 00:11:51,984
Not product, product line does.

163
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:53,625
That's what in combination.

164
00:11:54,145 --> 00:11:54,947
That's what it is.

165
00:11:55,086 --> 00:12:04,375
And then we have not just upon L2 and L3, but who defined these L1, L2, L3, who are the responsible person who has to define these?

166
00:12:05,956 --> 00:12:08,639
Well, right now, what we have is, I don't even actually know.

167
00:12:08,739 --> 00:12:13,523
I mean, architecture worked with a bunch of senior leaders to come up with a number of definitions.

168
00:12:14,802 --> 00:12:19,207
So, that is who defined the ones that we have.

169
00:12:19,227 --> 00:12:21,890
So, can you see a business capability index I have for LeanIX here?

170
00:12:24,094 --> 00:12:25,936
I can see the screen.

171
00:12:26,336 --> 00:12:26,657
Yeah.

172
00:12:26,716 --> 00:12:35,288
Okay, so if I look at this, now if I look at the L ones that they have defined, you would look at this and say, okay, here my product line is R&D and engineer.

173
00:12:37,971 --> 00:12:38,873
Makes sense, right?

174
00:12:39,033 --> 00:12:40,274
It's a rational thing because it's there.

175
00:12:40,315 --> 00:12:41,417
Those are already defined.

176
00:12:42,278 --> 00:12:44,100
Normally there's eight, we have 33.

177
00:12:45,903 --> 00:12:51,051
Then if I came down again, a little level to L2s, now I would see is, okay, well, there's a bunch of them.

178
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:55,277
So wait, this is limb, so this is going to be, you know, 212.

179
00:12:55,657 --> 00:12:58,802
So it was the R&D engineering and lab management.

180
00:12:59,001 --> 00:13:02,628
Now, if I want to hit the level three, because they have an additional level here.

181
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:09,618
And theoretically, this is an additional level because they missed the old one.

182
00:13:09,638 --> 00:13:12,923
But let's then I come down to 21.

183
00:13:15,822 --> 00:13:16,342
lab management.

184
00:13:16,783 --> 00:13:21,429
Now they could be, limbs itself could be one of these lab management data.

185
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:24,274
So maybe there are 21, 2, 3 lab management data management.

186
00:13:27,119 --> 00:13:32,827
And they're different than whoever is doing lab data visualization or real material management or any of the other management.

187
00:13:33,548 --> 00:13:41,520
So assuming that these are the correct ones because these are the ones that are set up currently in Leon IX and they're pretty adamant about keeping them that way.

188
00:13:41,561 --> 00:13:42,942
They're not going to change them at this point.

189
00:13:43,565 --> 00:13:45,626
So just one question, come.

190
00:13:46,347 --> 00:13:49,971
I think Leonides, at least let's take the example of R&D.

191
00:13:50,513 --> 00:13:51,594
Okay.

192
00:13:51,614 --> 00:13:58,802
I'm not sure if you have access, maybe we can look at it, download and see what Leonie X has.

193
00:13:59,363 --> 00:14:10,416
But my understanding is Chris Smith has already defined his L1 and L2L3 capabilities and based on what I'm hearing,

194
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:14,134
I mean, there's nobody else deciding these things.

195
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:16,998
It's us, or it's them, right?

196
00:14:17,097 --> 00:14:24,048
We have not taken a stab and said, Brian has not told us saying that we'll go with the industry best practices.

197
00:14:24,269 --> 00:14:26,892
Somebody actually has to make it.

198
00:14:27,052 --> 00:14:29,556
This is the Lenax data that we're looking at right now.

199
00:14:29,576 --> 00:14:31,219
This is not industry best practices.

200
00:14:31,698 --> 00:14:34,243
This specifically is Lenax.

201
00:14:34,563 --> 00:14:36,807
Okay, let me see what I have.

202
00:14:37,427 --> 00:14:40,993
I have what Chris gave me was one second.

203
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:48,326
He has given, if you don't mind, I'll steal the share for one second and I'll give it back to you.

204
00:14:49,769 --> 00:14:53,075
This is what he has given me, unless it has changed.

205
00:14:53,115 --> 00:14:58,424
I don't know what's the latest, but this is what he's saying.

206
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:00,989
These are the L2 capabilities.

207
00:15:01,129 --> 00:15:02,269
These are the L3.

208
00:15:02,671 --> 00:15:05,936
So according to him, these are the product.

209
00:15:05,956 --> 00:15:10,101
No, I think this is product line product groups and products.

210
00:15:10,403 --> 00:15:11,924
This is how they are looking at it.

211
00:15:12,306 --> 00:15:15,549
And then maybe Lynne's Paul center regulatory.

212
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:17,994
I don't know regulatory of clinical.

213
00:15:18,014 --> 00:15:18,674
I'm not sure.

214
00:15:18,654 --> 00:15:21,960
But this is what I was expecting to see in Linux.

215
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,823
If this is not matching, then we need.

216
00:15:24,844 --> 00:15:25,705
And that'll never come back.

217
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:28,509
That'll never end up in Linux because those aren't actual categories.

218
00:15:28,548 --> 00:15:34,096
Those are actually, you know, medical safety is not a category because it could fit in 50 different places.

219
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,722
It's not going to show up in capabilities.

220
00:15:37,783 --> 00:15:43,431
Now, what Chris has here, my understanding is he got this agreed upon with senior leaders.

221
00:15:44,288 --> 00:15:45,330
We're following up.

222
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:46,491
I had a conversation with Brian on it.

223
00:15:46,511 --> 00:15:48,455
We're having some follow up with it on it already.

224
00:15:48,515 --> 00:15:55,528
But the idea was, do we adapt to what Lena X is saying or do we let every single group do it the way they want to do it?

225
00:15:55,607 --> 00:16:02,780
Because the problem that we have, and I think it's a little off track of the conversation where I've been here because we can let them tell us anything they want.

226
00:16:03,221 --> 00:16:05,706
We have to make a decision on what

227
00:16:05,686 --> 00:16:06,847
We're going to use this.

228
00:16:07,187 --> 00:16:08,850
There's a hundred charts out there.

229
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:11,313
Fortunately, we are not getting, I'm stopping my share.

230
00:16:11,695 --> 00:16:14,700
I'll take, if you give me that list, I'm going to take both of them.

231
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:22,571
I'm going to send it to Chris Smith and Chris Serito, coffee, Brian, you and Sara and say, pick one.

232
00:16:22,591 --> 00:16:23,572
We are moving forward.

233
00:16:23,592 --> 00:16:26,216
Yeah, Brian must have already happened.

234
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:28,980
So it is that a government.

235
00:16:29,081 --> 00:16:30,043
Okay, it's already.

236
00:16:30,062 --> 00:16:30,903
Brian already has it.

237
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:32,726
He's headed for a few days and he's going through it.

238
00:16:32,846 --> 00:16:33,668
So

239
00:16:33,648 --> 00:16:36,711
You can check on his status with it, and let's go that way.

240
00:16:37,133 --> 00:16:43,280
But it's actually nothing.

241
00:16:43,321 --> 00:16:46,846
I was trying to explain why we do it the way we do it.

242
00:16:47,167 --> 00:16:50,591
What chart we use doesn't matter, and I don't want to go too far off of what chart.

243
00:16:51,032 --> 00:16:52,995
We know there's questions of which chart we're going to use.

244
00:16:53,075 --> 00:16:55,317
I don't want to get stuck in that.

245
00:16:55,585 --> 00:16:58,169
The idea is, we keep talking about business.

246
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:05,986
For us, if we ask people to map to some end to capabilities, we have to give them the end to capabilities to say, map it.

247
00:17:06,807 --> 00:17:09,532
Now, which end to capability will put in front of them?

248
00:17:09,553 --> 00:17:11,416
We'll try to put whatever is expected.

249
00:17:11,396 --> 00:17:12,318
online.

250
00:17:12,659 --> 00:17:16,286
I think if they want to throw some dabs, evolve up, that's up to them.

251
00:17:16,685 --> 00:17:21,315
But at this point of time, the direction I've got is don't disrupt anything.

252
00:17:21,335 --> 00:17:25,040
If there's something already existing, just go with it.

253
00:17:25,582 --> 00:17:29,108
That's the strong direction I obviously, but I might be wrong.

254
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:32,595
There might be something else that's going on right now.

255
00:17:32,575 --> 00:17:37,904
This team is looking for carless, not like, hey, maybe this or that.

256
00:17:38,025 --> 00:17:47,482
We need to go with one list so that they can finish the activity of mapping because if we put two lists in front of Reginae and say, hey, ask them if they can map here.

257
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:48,384
This is better.

258
00:17:48,404 --> 00:17:49,646
This is Chris says.

259
00:17:49,787 --> 00:17:50,548
You can map here.

260
00:17:50,608 --> 00:17:52,092
This is what Chris mid says.

261
00:17:52,532 --> 00:17:54,035
It will be very confusing to them.

262
00:17:54,055 --> 00:17:55,478
We need to give them one list.

263
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:58,026
Like Christmas, if you set it off, fight it out.

264
00:17:58,667 --> 00:18:03,544
One list comes out of it and that list goes to this train as simple as that.

265
00:18:04,402 --> 00:18:06,965
And Prishandhi, I have a follow up question on that.

266
00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:11,271
So you have shared that slide that we have it from long, right?

267
00:18:11,932 --> 00:18:13,536
It talks about L2L3.

268
00:18:13,915 --> 00:18:20,465
So when we are in a workshop, are we asking the business to verify it, whether this is correct or not?

269
00:18:20,786 --> 00:18:23,450
Because it's the audience.

270
00:18:23,631 --> 00:18:27,435
Whoever you have invited, I'm assuming they have the decision makers over there.

271
00:18:27,876 --> 00:18:29,578
It could be the technical leader.

272
00:18:29,598 --> 00:18:31,201
It could be the business.

273
00:18:31,342 --> 00:18:32,703
It's a collaborative thing.

274
00:18:32,683 --> 00:18:40,354
If they are saying, take this application, take there is this, whatever, Anaplan did demand planning.

275
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:47,583
Yes, the technical person is saying this, does the business person agree or his capability is delivered?

276
00:18:47,803 --> 00:18:50,807
Do they use Anaplan for supply planning?

277
00:18:50,846 --> 00:18:51,949
That's the biggest question.

278
00:18:52,288 --> 00:18:56,193
Yes, yes, yes, that's the application.

279
00:18:56,596 --> 00:18:59,701
That's the capability, that's how you navigate.

280
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:04,428
And we might be just talking about one product here because we are just talking pioneers.

281
00:19:04,808 --> 00:19:08,094
But ideally, like Farley is saying, we should do top down.

282
00:19:08,134 --> 00:19:10,257
But we are not in that space.

283
00:19:10,277 --> 00:19:11,439
We are doing bottoms up.

284
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:21,674
So maybe in that entire hierarchy, it's only one box you're going to pick up and say, hey, these two applications, we have been talking about mass to this supply plan.

285
00:19:21,992 --> 00:19:22,413
That's it.

286
00:19:23,034 --> 00:19:24,455
You map it done.

287
00:19:25,076 --> 00:19:27,459
Then you say, OK, the product, whatever.

288
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:32,845
Finalize the name, finalize the age to capability, finalize the applications.

289
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:36,269
That's your two-way mapping, right?

290
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:38,191
At least stop there.

291
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:39,932
We are not going to boil the ocean.

292
00:19:39,952 --> 00:19:42,615
At this point of time, it's too late.

293
00:19:42,695 --> 00:19:45,578
We have been debating on this three months, four months.

294
00:19:45,598 --> 00:19:46,519
We don't have answer.

295
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:51,105
And unfortunately, I'm ready to make a decision today.

296
00:19:51,085 --> 00:19:52,847
somebody gave me the option.

297
00:19:53,148 --> 00:19:54,510
Khan will make it today.

298
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:56,934
If somebody empowered him, right?

299
00:19:57,036 --> 00:20:01,723
If Brian told Khan, you are 100% accountable for this structure.

300
00:20:01,884 --> 00:20:02,525
Go put it.

301
00:20:02,986 --> 00:20:07,074
I'm sure he'll come up with the best in class taxonomy.

302
00:20:07,134 --> 00:20:09,939
And we can say this is the taxonomy aligned to it.

303
00:20:10,338 --> 00:20:11,862
But nobody is empowering us.

304
00:20:11,842 --> 00:20:13,464
That's the biggest problem.

305
00:20:13,945 --> 00:20:16,912
Without empowerment, we can be talking, talking, talking.

306
00:20:16,932 --> 00:20:19,897
We might be having the best taxonomy in the world.

307
00:20:19,998 --> 00:20:25,107
We cannot operationalize it because the leaders are not supporting.

308
00:20:25,425 --> 00:20:39,461
In the end, it's owned by architecture in the end, because they're the ones who have to set this up for the... I understood that they do have a set up, and we are having the discussion whether or not we just go with it.

309
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:44,405
And right now, they don't want to change anything again, because they're going to miss all their dates, because they have to get their stuff in there.

310
00:20:44,747 --> 00:20:52,615
But the reality of it is, what we really need to understand is how this stuff relates to what we're talking about, and how do we explain it to people.

311
00:20:52,595 --> 00:20:57,880
What it is can be debated forever for a bunch of leaders want to go argue 50 different times.

312
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:58,861
I don't care.

313
00:20:58,881 --> 00:21:07,309
The reality of it is there's a direct mapping between business capabilities and lines and groups and teams.

314
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:10,212
That's how the two go together and they go together for that way for a reason.

315
00:21:10,692 --> 00:21:19,682
There's the reasoning behind this in a lot of cases is when you're dealing with a product model for one product doesn't necessarily fit every single type of organization, but

316
00:21:19,662 --> 00:21:23,586
By understanding where the business capabilities are, they do fit every organization.

317
00:21:23,988 --> 00:21:29,355
No matter what kind of organization it is, whether it's an infrastructure or a R&D organization, it doesn't matter.

318
00:21:30,256 --> 00:21:35,362
The idea is that what it gives us is a standard methodology for understanding how we're doing.

319
00:21:35,542 --> 00:21:37,184
So you can set metrics.

320
00:21:37,204 --> 00:21:43,152
You can say, am I spending on this capability in the same range as my competition?

321
00:21:44,314 --> 00:21:48,318
Am I delivering time frame wise?

322
00:21:48,838 --> 00:21:59,273
indirect alignment with my competition by putting capabilities in and as a rational way and mapping those capabilities in a standard way, it gives us an ability to go against other information that we have.

323
00:21:59,814 --> 00:22:03,640
Now we can do that data analytics and data-driven decision making that makes sense.

324
00:22:04,421 --> 00:22:08,046
If we say we now want to invest in growth,

325
00:22:09,426 --> 00:22:17,217
If we're overspending in five places, but we're underspending on the things that help with growth, we know where we can move things around in a very rational way and make sense.

326
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:22,784
The idea behind the business capability model is that ability to attach ourselves to something.

327
00:22:22,923 --> 00:22:32,615
If I go to Gartner and say, what is the average that a CPG company of over $5 billion will spend on HR?

328
00:22:33,912 --> 00:22:36,435
It'll give me an idea whether I'm in the ballpark or not.

329
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:42,988
When we say that we spend too much on things, because we'll hear that quite a bit in a lot of our meetings, people say we're spending too much on.

330
00:22:43,568 --> 00:22:44,810
That's where those numbers come from.

331
00:22:45,392 --> 00:22:50,119
But we are currently at such a high level that we know we spend too much on IT.

332
00:22:50,621 --> 00:22:53,085
We don't know we spend too much on what.

333
00:22:53,385 --> 00:22:55,809
So that is a lot of the purpose of why it's there.

334
00:22:55,910 --> 00:23:00,596
But we want the product teams to understand is that these capabilities match up to something.

335
00:23:01,137 --> 00:23:07,788
When we're saying that, you know, you need to do these, they're important because they're giving us an actual data driven something.

336
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:11,615
You know, we don't know whether we're doing good better and different.

337
00:23:11,634 --> 00:23:13,538
We only know it from the context of us.

338
00:23:15,137 --> 00:23:25,119
The current leadership, the current and a lot of other things are looking at us and the street will look at us and say, are they doing a good job at a high level?

339
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,186
And that's always been the number, but the next level down matters.

340
00:23:29,229 --> 00:23:33,618
There was the question of, are we spending too much on IT or are we just not making enough money to cover it?

341
00:23:35,557 --> 00:23:36,479
So you have two choices.

342
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:37,661
You always have two choices.

343
00:23:37,681 --> 00:23:40,144
Do you know what I'm saying?

344
00:23:40,164 --> 00:23:50,323
I hear you and kind of angry, but only my question here is now totally, you know, it has to be done that way and then there is a talk.

345
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:58,115
But now right now, we started with this pioneer and the immediate test, please correct me.

346
00:23:58,135 --> 00:24:00,400
Okay, this is what it's coming in my mind.

347
00:24:00,531 --> 00:24:21,982
We do have a capability map either we can go with the presentation one or you know the one which we have pulled it from the line you extend and then we will ask the business to get it verify and do that and another thing is because we might be at L3 or even below that because we could be at the application level.

348
00:24:21,962 --> 00:24:26,470
What could be the different applications are there in that L3?

349
00:24:26,951 --> 00:24:30,336
Maybe is that something to outcome that we look for?

350
00:24:30,757 --> 00:24:32,881
I mean, this is what it's coming for.

351
00:24:32,901 --> 00:24:34,363
But that's being mapped separately right now.

352
00:24:34,423 --> 00:24:38,509
That is a separate exercise that's been going on fairly actively right now.

353
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:43,617
I'm actually meeting with Brian's going to have a communication going on on the application list shortly.

354
00:24:44,779 --> 00:24:46,823
Products and applications do not equal.

355
00:24:47,089 --> 00:24:52,356
So you could have three applications in a product or you could have one application in a product.

356
00:24:52,416 --> 00:24:53,117
It doesn't matter.

357
00:24:53,178 --> 00:24:57,784
I mean, like if your workday you may say is, okay, HR core is all in workday, so I have one application.

358
00:24:58,184 --> 00:24:58,986
Good.

359
00:24:59,006 --> 00:24:59,286
Fine.

360
00:24:59,306 --> 00:25:04,973
If you looked at total rewards, total rewards had a dozen applications underneath it.

361
00:25:04,993 --> 00:25:07,997
But they're all vendor manage, but they had a bunch of applications underneath them.

362
00:25:08,438 --> 00:25:10,401
So they're all, but they're all the same product.

363
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,202
They're just different things.

364
00:25:12,672 --> 00:25:15,655
So, you know, it was the CCR one-stream conversation.

365
00:25:15,796 --> 00:25:19,421
If a mid was the one running CCR, it should be CCR.

366
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:23,665
If a mid's only running one stream, is one stream the only thing, and is there somebody above him?

367
00:25:24,126 --> 00:25:29,353
Now, if there isn't, then maybe they have two different, you know, L3s, and that's what they have.

368
00:25:29,452 --> 00:25:35,862
One is one stream, which we would probably call the name, not by its product name, you know, the software product name.

369
00:25:36,342 --> 00:25:37,042
But,

370
00:25:37,022 --> 00:25:41,307
You know, there's lots of different ways to look at these things, but we are currently working on the application list.

371
00:25:41,326 --> 00:25:42,367
That's something else that's being done.

372
00:25:42,407 --> 00:25:43,669
And it's being done as an Ampika.

373
00:25:43,689 --> 00:25:45,730
Brian said it should be done as an Amp.

374
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:50,894
So Shanti has called something like that.

375
00:25:50,914 --> 00:25:52,715
We have 12 minutes left.

376
00:25:53,237 --> 00:25:58,821
So my question is, what was the outcome you wanted to achieve on this call for Bill?

377
00:25:58,842 --> 00:26:01,243
Because I see outcome for vision session.

378
00:26:01,824 --> 00:26:03,726
One thing of the vision session.

379
00:26:03,746 --> 00:26:06,387
Yeah, that's what we want.

380
00:26:06,367 --> 00:26:09,692
Unless there's any other questions specifically to this thing.

381
00:26:10,031 --> 00:26:11,394
Again, this is an informational thing.

382
00:26:11,433 --> 00:26:16,538
If you go with the slide that Chris gave us, it's going to be less hassle, less argument, and it does not going to make really a difference anyway.

383
00:26:16,578 --> 00:26:17,579
So I would just go with that.

384
00:26:18,181 --> 00:26:22,224
But I'm sure we're going to change something, but that's OK.

385
00:26:22,265 --> 00:26:22,846
It doesn't matter.

386
00:26:22,905 --> 00:26:25,009
I mean, you should go with what Chris is.

387
00:26:25,308 --> 00:26:29,492
What you really want to know is if they own a function here, no matter what it's called, we call it 1.1.1.

388
00:26:30,233 --> 00:26:30,595
Who cares?

389
00:26:32,036 --> 00:26:33,657
What applications they have underneath that?

390
00:26:34,464 --> 00:26:40,673
And if they can say that there's applications under that and we can identify a TPO, that's a positive thing because most of our TPO's are wrong in all of our data.

391
00:26:41,213 --> 00:26:44,598
So that's a huge step forward, so I would go with it.

392
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:49,164
But is there anything else anybody need to know about what the point of capabilities is?

393
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,853
So we should call, yeah, we shall go ahead.

394
00:26:55,953 --> 00:27:03,644
So the intent of the session was we wanted to try and understand how to incorporate lean Ix into

395
00:27:04,267 --> 00:27:06,772
the conversation that we're having with the limbs tomorrow.

396
00:27:07,253 --> 00:27:16,196
So we have a draft deck that we've created and I'm sharing information and you can opine on what you want us to do with it.

397
00:27:16,597 --> 00:27:20,267
So first question is, when we meet with some kids tomorrow,

398
00:27:21,174 --> 00:27:29,146
Uh, we're going to go over the full value mapping, right, which is the target that the two slides that I think you.

399
00:27:29,708 --> 00:27:31,911
Can I see the content, please?

400
00:27:31,931 --> 00:27:33,773
I don't want to be a ceiling.

401
00:27:34,214 --> 00:27:35,435
I want to see the content.

402
00:27:35,455 --> 00:27:38,821
I want to know who is because I don't see anything on my calendar.

403
00:27:39,061 --> 00:27:41,184
So I'm not sure why I'm not invited.

404
00:27:42,426 --> 00:27:49,156
Uh, so I want to be there to understand what's going on in the sessions because I don't want another escalation from

405
00:27:49,863 --> 00:27:50,364
That's correct.

406
00:27:50,384 --> 00:27:57,031
So this is me and Unuch are tagging, so Rajani can you forward the session?

407
00:27:57,593 --> 00:28:00,856
So this is the product vision session, right?

408
00:28:00,876 --> 00:28:08,526
So the first thing that we go over is this high, I want Temi and Sankey to first understand the full end to end picture.

409
00:28:08,967 --> 00:28:12,330
So we're going to go through this slide and this slide, right?

410
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:13,132
Okay.

411
00:28:13,152 --> 00:28:14,794
Just one feedback, right there.

412
00:28:14,933 --> 00:28:16,375
Go back to that slide.

413
00:28:16,957 --> 00:28:17,237
Yep.

414
00:28:17,436 --> 00:28:20,763
The first zero needs to have OKRs over there.

415
00:28:20,903 --> 00:28:22,267
Can view OKRs?

416
00:28:22,346 --> 00:28:23,388
Can you take the data?

417
00:28:23,409 --> 00:28:25,292
I don't want the objective and key results.

418
00:28:25,733 --> 00:28:27,557
OKRs should come there.

419
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:30,463
Or put it in the brackets, whatever.

420
00:28:30,483 --> 00:28:31,886
Can view OKRs?

421
00:28:31,906 --> 00:28:33,990
Is that what you want?

422
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:36,797
Yeah, I think you take the data OKRs or whatever.

423
00:28:36,936 --> 00:28:38,500
KTV, OKR.

424
00:28:39,813 --> 00:28:40,596
Oh, just OK.

425
00:28:41,077 --> 00:28:41,338
Got it.

426
00:28:41,378 --> 00:28:41,980
I just sped up.

427
00:28:42,021 --> 00:28:47,301
I want the keyword OKR over there, because you have put it in step two OKR.

428
00:28:47,702 --> 00:28:51,257
In step two, you have to put it as product OKRs.

429
00:28:51,642 --> 00:28:55,226
Remember, you are using language very loosely.

430
00:28:55,266 --> 00:29:01,491
This can have impact because I sat down with Sara Yafan and convinced her, you're okay.

431
00:29:01,511 --> 00:29:03,334
I said, here, this is our okay.

432
00:29:03,713 --> 00:29:06,857
And she was a light because Sara Goodman is not convinced.

433
00:29:06,877 --> 00:29:14,546
So you need to be very critical because when you're translating it to Dex, you're losing the feedback that people are giving you.

434
00:29:15,246 --> 00:29:15,527
Okay.

435
00:29:16,027 --> 00:29:16,688
Yeah.

436
00:29:16,708 --> 00:29:18,730
So this is the high level view.

437
00:29:19,704 --> 00:29:25,493
that is being shared tomorrow, which is the first 10, 15 minutes.

438
00:29:25,673 --> 00:29:33,306
Can you please change that to can you OKR and the left put objective key results in the brackets?

439
00:29:35,809 --> 00:29:40,636
Sorry, I am very picky on those things, because I'm facing the front of it.

440
00:29:41,979 --> 00:29:45,324
And you can remove the last key, but yeah, OKR.

441
00:29:46,346 --> 00:29:47,607
OK?

442
00:29:47,627 --> 00:29:47,788
Yeah.

443
00:29:49,928 --> 00:29:51,169
So you'll go through this.

444
00:29:51,609 --> 00:29:59,078
We're first actually trying to talk about this distinction between SPM and the product model.

445
00:29:59,098 --> 00:30:03,022
So I think this slide should be first, but you tell me if you want to cover it afterwards.

446
00:30:03,042 --> 00:30:09,951
I think this is the SPM story, which is, hey, this is where you start and then this is how you go around in the circle.

447
00:30:09,991 --> 00:30:11,933
This is where we come in, right?

448
00:30:12,013 --> 00:30:18,821
This is where we are coming in with our six steps and then this is where we tie the execution and the business value on the metrics and API.

449
00:30:18,801 --> 00:30:21,205
So it's basically tying that big picture together.

450
00:30:21,246 --> 00:30:22,167
That's slide number one.

451
00:30:22,788 --> 00:30:23,569
Slide number two.

452
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:23,971
Okay.

453
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:30,423
Now we'll go into the detailed steps, not session two steps on how to achieve what we talked about in the previous slide.

454
00:30:30,903 --> 00:30:32,586
And then I know just go through.

455
00:30:33,047 --> 00:30:33,749
Okay.

456
00:30:33,888 --> 00:30:34,009
Here's

457
00:30:33,989 --> 00:30:36,913
There's two only two, we've kept it very light, right?

458
00:30:36,933 --> 00:30:37,976
We've kept it high level.

459
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:46,430
Yes, what vision means, here's what a vision statement should look like, and then we'll go into the workshop saying, okay, here's an example that we gave you for Google.

460
00:30:46,851 --> 00:30:49,955
We want you to put that workshop, and then I want you to put it into Gira.

461
00:30:50,424 --> 00:30:53,909
So then you're going to go into the G-R structure, that same standard structure.

462
00:30:53,929 --> 00:30:55,289
So let me just go through the slides.

463
00:30:55,589 --> 00:30:58,053
I just quickly talked about all this.

464
00:30:58,073 --> 00:31:00,875
So first step is, here's the vision.

465
00:31:01,056 --> 00:31:03,758
Two slides on what is the vision, blah, blah, blah.

466
00:31:04,378 --> 00:31:10,865
Next one is, you need a vision statement for your product at the product level that has these things captured in it.

467
00:31:10,885 --> 00:31:11,726
Who is it for?

468
00:31:11,886 --> 00:31:13,087
So where is the template?

469
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:14,429
Where will they capture it?

470
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:19,233
The template is over here at the bottom, which is in the last place.

471
00:31:19,805 --> 00:31:20,846
put the template next.

472
00:31:21,467 --> 00:31:23,810
So you said, you're going to teach them.

473
00:31:24,511 --> 00:31:25,613
This is not a template.

474
00:31:25,813 --> 00:31:26,714
This is an example.

475
00:31:26,755 --> 00:31:28,436
Where is the template?

476
00:31:28,457 --> 00:31:32,782
So this is what Anuj is saying that, see, we are basically asking them to come up with a piece.

477
00:31:32,843 --> 00:31:34,285
I'm not just cutting to the chair.

478
00:31:34,424 --> 00:31:35,767
I'm not sure, template.

479
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:38,191
All I am saying is, where is the template?

480
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:40,394
I need that template in the next slide.

481
00:31:40,433 --> 00:31:43,357
If you're asking them to fill a template, they get a template.

482
00:31:43,597 --> 00:31:46,301
Because this was made clear in the last call.

483
00:31:46,281 --> 00:31:46,963
It's right.

484
00:31:46,983 --> 00:31:49,992
I gave the call with Sake and Timmy.

485
00:31:50,053 --> 00:31:53,262
So Sake and Timmy just said give me a template.

486
00:31:53,282 --> 00:31:57,115
Peshanti, I'll make him feel the template and we still are talking.

487
00:31:57,134 --> 00:31:57,896
There's a template.

488
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:58,659
There's a template.

489
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:00,063
I don't see the template.

490
00:32:00,083 --> 00:32:00,965
Is this a template?

491
00:32:02,194 --> 00:32:04,538
I don't think I have access to it.

492
00:32:04,618 --> 00:32:06,240
It doesn't look like a template.

493
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,044
This is not how the template looks.

494
00:32:08,064 --> 00:32:09,526
I'm sorry to say.

495
00:32:09,546 --> 00:32:13,673
Can I give you a little bit of executiveness that you have to put over here?

496
00:32:13,712 --> 00:32:15,255
If it is who, what, why?

497
00:32:15,315 --> 00:32:16,877
You're just going to randomly put here.

498
00:32:16,897 --> 00:32:20,002
They can send it in a email.

499
00:32:20,624 --> 00:32:26,673
This is the output of the workshop where I think he's going to do the workshop, which is here is what we're going to go through.

500
00:32:26,993 --> 00:32:27,914
Here are the things that

501
00:32:28,097 --> 00:32:34,788
If there should be the immoral board, there should be a template where they're putting sticky notes.

502
00:32:35,169 --> 00:32:36,692
There needs to be something, guys.

503
00:32:36,811 --> 00:32:40,498
If you're saying a working session, how will you let them do it?

504
00:32:40,518 --> 00:32:41,460
Who is the scribe?

505
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:49,211
Are you going to open a mural board for four sections and say, hey, drop in your things over there.

506
00:32:49,528 --> 00:32:50,390
This is the one there.

507
00:32:50,871 --> 00:32:55,278
So this is what the screen shot there and say we are going to capture.

508
00:32:55,318 --> 00:32:58,002
There needs to be specific steps.

509
00:32:58,144 --> 00:32:59,445
You will give five minutes.

510
00:32:59,726 --> 00:33:01,288
Have you timed your session?

511
00:33:01,388 --> 00:33:02,971
How much time on which will speak?

512
00:33:03,413 --> 00:33:03,993
When will you?

513
00:33:04,034 --> 00:33:05,817
How much time is this entire thing?

514
00:33:05,836 --> 00:33:07,480
We are going to open up a mural board.

515
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,781
You know this takes time.

516
00:33:09,363 --> 00:33:11,425
People are thinking people are putting.

517
00:33:11,445 --> 00:33:12,769
They might not put anything.

518
00:33:13,308 --> 00:33:13,630
So

519
00:33:13,609 --> 00:33:24,448
Are you making them do it in the session or are you going to give them one slide at template and say, do however you want, but put the vision ultimately.

520
00:33:24,708 --> 00:33:25,469
What are you saying?

521
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:34,163
So in the session, Anuj is planning that in the session, we will ask because we are giving them guidance in the session, we're giving them the Uber example.

522
00:33:34,203 --> 00:33:39,853
The goal is that they will use that example to fill out the template, right?

523
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:41,542
That is the intent.

524
00:33:41,903 --> 00:33:43,788
Let me just, I think I have access to it now.

525
00:33:43,808 --> 00:33:44,391
Thank you for that.

526
00:33:45,373 --> 00:33:48,241
Oh, I think it's still working, but whatever.

527
00:33:48,261 --> 00:33:50,247
So you're throwing me this neural board.

528
00:33:50,307 --> 00:33:51,210
What will you tell me?

529
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,192
Okay, I am circuit.

530
00:33:52,594 --> 00:33:55,362
What are you asking?

531
00:33:56,236 --> 00:33:57,478
So let's do it right now.

532
00:33:57,618 --> 00:34:00,884
I'm not I'm not sure we have this pretty.

533
00:34:01,365 --> 00:34:03,570
You don't know how you people are delivering.

534
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:06,015
You all are scrambling with me.

535
00:34:06,455 --> 00:34:08,360
One of you showing the mural board.

536
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,344
One of you showing the appendix slide.

537
00:34:10,364 --> 00:34:12,809
One of you don't have a game plan.

538
00:34:12,829 --> 00:34:13,349
Sorry.

539
00:34:13,329 --> 00:34:15,393
You don't, none of you have a given plan.

540
00:34:15,753 --> 00:34:18,117
You have no strategy how you are going to go there.

541
00:34:18,197 --> 00:34:19,418
You have no strategy.

542
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,922
How will you ask them to, okay, you're doing a session.

543
00:34:22,963 --> 00:34:24,204
What will be the output?

544
00:34:24,686 --> 00:34:27,449
You're saying Jira Vishal, I see a mural board.

545
00:34:27,829 --> 00:34:29,311
Who is doing what?

546
00:34:30,313 --> 00:34:33,217
I'm doing the opening, right?

547
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:36,402
I'm doing the opening where I'm giving the big picture.

548
00:34:36,668 --> 00:34:40,572
and then Anuj is going to walk through the first few slides with the examples, right?

549
00:34:40,592 --> 00:34:45,516
So my, my story is I'm going to do the opening and then how much time is this session?

550
00:34:45,536 --> 00:34:46,297
I'm doing 10 minutes.

551
00:34:46,336 --> 00:34:48,498
Anuj is doing 50, 60 minutes session.

552
00:34:49,059 --> 00:34:50,840
Out of the 15 minutes, we are basic.

553
00:34:51,021 --> 00:34:54,184
Anuj is going to take the first 10, 15 minutes to talk.

554
00:34:54,284 --> 00:34:54,503
Hold on.

555
00:34:54,543 --> 00:34:55,485
Hold on.

556
00:34:55,625 --> 00:34:55,945
Hold on.

557
00:34:56,365 --> 00:34:56,945
10 minutes.

558
00:34:57,025 --> 00:34:57,586
You're done.

559
00:34:57,706 --> 00:34:59,288
You, you cover your three slides.

560
00:34:59,307 --> 00:35:00,248
15 minutes.

561
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:01,951
He's doing this workshop.

562
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:04,572
But, but you were talking about mapping.

563
00:35:04,592 --> 00:35:06,275
Where is the mapping part of it?

564
00:35:06,295 --> 00:35:06,675
Where are you?

565
00:35:06,655 --> 00:35:23,753
So the theory part is, so the next 15-20 minutes, right, which is the first half hour of the session, we're going to cover the theory, right, which is, this is how you do it, which 30 minutes over in the next 30 minutes, what are you doing?

566
00:35:26,027 --> 00:35:26,648
looking session.

567
00:35:27,389 --> 00:35:33,418
And we're just going to give the example so that they can start thinking about, hey, look, let's use the Uber example to talk about this, ooh, what, why, what.

568
00:35:33,998 --> 00:35:36,382
Now apply this to your product.

569
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:41,050
And that's where we are introducing the mirror board, which is over here, which is the workshop agenda.

570
00:35:41,449 --> 00:35:43,432
This is the 30 minute workshop.

571
00:35:43,452 --> 00:35:46,097
Now when the mirror is the mapping, the mirror is the mapping.

572
00:35:47,197 --> 00:35:48,981
The mirror you're asking them to map.

573
00:35:50,074 --> 00:35:51,657
mapping it back into Gira, right?

574
00:35:51,677 --> 00:35:52,460
That's what you're asking.

575
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,864
Is that what you said Gira?

576
00:35:54,885 --> 00:35:55,726
That is one thing.

577
00:35:55,806 --> 00:35:58,251
What about we are talking about all these L2Ks?

578
00:35:58,572 --> 00:35:58,791
L2Ks?

579
00:35:58,913 --> 00:35:59,253
L2Ks?

580
00:35:59,333 --> 00:35:59,875
L2Ks?

581
00:35:59,894 --> 00:36:01,737
L2Ks?

582
00:36:01,797 --> 00:36:02,480
L2Ks?

583
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:02,860
L2Ks?

584
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,844
L2Ks?

585
00:36:05,125 --> 00:36:06,327
L2Ks?

586
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:07,869
L2Ks?

587
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:08,150
L2Ks?

588
00:36:08,889 --> 00:36:13,396
One day we are not even 24 hours away from the session.

589
00:36:13,416 --> 00:36:15,500
I don't see a skeleton.

590
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:18,724
I don't see which slide is getting delivered by whom.

591
00:36:19,065 --> 00:36:21,570
I don't see how much time we are preserving forward.

592
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:23,032
I see something over here.

593
00:36:23,052 --> 00:36:24,755
45 minutes of discussion.

594
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:25,835
I'm synthesized.

595
00:36:26,958 --> 00:36:28,940
Why should they be even doing it?

596
00:36:29,157 --> 00:36:31,699
Along with you, I don't understand these visions.

597
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:37,606
You're not giving them capabilities to say, hey, map your vision to capabilities.

598
00:36:37,626 --> 00:36:38,467
You're not.

599
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:45,155
And there was a better slide, a better template of a vision where it had a couple of bosses over there.

600
00:36:45,175 --> 00:36:46,958
What is the purpose of the product?

601
00:36:46,978 --> 00:36:47,998
What is this?

602
00:36:48,358 --> 00:36:51,762
That would automatically give you a into capability.

603
00:36:51,782 --> 00:36:55,047
Because if a circuit says, what's the purpose of limbs?

604
00:36:55,027 --> 00:37:11,416
even really might be able to map it to L2, but now you're not asking anything just simply putting why what when they're going to give you one one line sentences and that will become your vision statement because they are saying give me a perfect template.

605
00:37:11,835 --> 00:37:13,077
I will fill it over there.

606
00:37:13,358 --> 00:37:17,405
So if you have all these questions which applications you map to which

607
00:37:17,385 --> 00:37:23,871
they should be a place in that template, which asks for those questions.

608
00:37:24,291 --> 00:37:27,896
If you don't ask for those questions, they're not going to answer your question.

609
00:37:29,097 --> 00:37:36,023
So can you give me that word document that you extracted out of Lean Ix where you have the L1, L2, this, whatever, right?

610
00:37:36,043 --> 00:37:36,724
The other product.

611
00:37:37,043 --> 00:37:44,271
If you send me that, I'll create a slide that says, at the output of this session, these are the things that we want for links.

612
00:37:44,909 --> 00:37:50,318
No, your template will not even be influenced by what he's keeping.

613
00:37:50,619 --> 00:37:53,463
He can give ABC XYZ, Vishal.

614
00:37:53,824 --> 00:37:55,809
Where is my vision template?

615
00:37:55,829 --> 00:38:00,217
I'm simply asking all of you guys, where is my vision template?

616
00:38:00,277 --> 00:38:05,125
Which says, hey, there needs to be a question for what are the two capabilities you're mapping?

617
00:38:05,365 --> 00:38:06,507
Who is your sponsor?

618
00:38:06,768 --> 00:38:08,030
Who is your stakeholders?

619
00:38:08,311 --> 00:38:09,313
Who is your...

620
00:38:09,293 --> 00:38:11,476
That's all thing is vision.

621
00:38:11,615 --> 00:38:14,501
You're all so focused on peace-mealing it.

622
00:38:15,242 --> 00:38:16,864
Vision is just what the prop.

623
00:38:16,884 --> 00:38:20,949
No, as a part of the vision, I want to know all these outline things.

624
00:38:20,969 --> 00:38:23,152
Who is your product owner, business owner?

625
00:38:23,554 --> 00:38:25,036
All these things need to be answered.

626
00:38:25,056 --> 00:38:27,438
This is your one shot you're getting with them.

627
00:38:28,059 --> 00:38:31,826
In one hour, ask them to fill all the missing information.

628
00:38:31,846 --> 00:38:34,710
You people told me, we don't know teams, we don't know.

629
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:44,673
To tell those boxes, there needs to be a pretty template, like a project charter template, a project, a mission template should be there, which is very prescriptive.

630
00:38:44,693 --> 00:38:46,077
You don't have to narrate it.

631
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:51,130
Any person should read and be, who is your business partner?

632
00:38:51,818 --> 00:38:53,860
Sake should be just simply able to fill it.

633
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:57,505
You don't have to teach him who is a business partner, right?

634
00:38:57,764 --> 00:39:03,452
Do you know who the Sake always keeps saying, hey, I work with my business, I do whatever he says.

635
00:39:03,853 --> 00:39:06,655
Do we know who that person is referring to?

636
00:39:07,177 --> 00:39:09,880
Does it take to requirements from 10 people, one person?

637
00:39:10,581 --> 00:39:11,902
Do we know that?

638
00:39:13,047 --> 00:39:15,373
Are you not pre-populated?

639
00:39:16,034 --> 00:39:22,751
For all six, if you're saying that you want a template for all six of this, we can just create that and share it with you at the moment.

640
00:39:22,771 --> 00:39:23,233
We can do that.

641
00:39:23,253 --> 00:39:24,175
All six weeks.

642
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,061
You're saying that I need from you, right?

643
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:28,128
We can do that.

644
00:39:28,148 --> 00:39:34,500
We can give them saying here's a template question.

645
00:39:35,242 --> 00:39:37,786
We have been talking about this for three months now.

646
00:39:38,347 --> 00:39:42,193
And what on which promise we was for every workshop there's a template.

647
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,476
And I don't see a template.

648
00:39:43,496 --> 00:39:44,117
I'm sorry.

649
00:39:44,177 --> 00:39:45,159
I'm losing it.

650
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,844
Either you tell me, Vishanti, you do it.

651
00:39:49,106 --> 00:39:52,251
Create a template, I'll tell you what the template is.

652
00:39:53,378 --> 00:40:02,954
But I'm not saying we're always talking, this could be one way, that could be one way, some one way we may be like the template or not.

653
00:40:03,114 --> 00:40:07,862
Whoever is asking them questions, you need to put that question there so that we get the answers.

654
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:11,168
At the end of the day, I'm really afraid guys.

655
00:40:11,148 --> 00:40:13,411
We will just get four sentences.

656
00:40:13,992 --> 00:40:14,713
What is that?

657
00:40:14,733 --> 00:40:16,996
He will say it's a lab management system.

658
00:40:17,237 --> 00:40:18,298
That will be his answer.

659
00:40:18,398 --> 00:40:18,980
I know some.

660
00:40:19,059 --> 00:40:19,681
It's very good.

661
00:40:20,141 --> 00:40:20,461
Okay.

662
00:40:20,882 --> 00:40:23,827
And then he will say, Hey, why do we need it?

663
00:40:23,987 --> 00:40:25,829
He'll say it's a GXP thing.

664
00:40:25,969 --> 00:40:26,289
I know.

665
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:27,932
It's a TQ process.

666
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:29,094
We cannot miss it.

667
00:40:29,155 --> 00:40:30,876
He's going to get crappy answers.

668
00:40:31,016 --> 00:40:31,538
Believe me.

669
00:40:32,139 --> 00:40:32,619
Okay.

670
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:35,764
And then you will say, I don't know why you got who I don't know.

671
00:40:36,125 --> 00:40:38,809
He'll just give you one line sentences.

672
00:40:38,789 --> 00:40:40,130
I will challenge you.

673
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:43,014
This is what is the template I have answered your questions.

674
00:40:43,153 --> 00:40:44,476
Rajini, you know him better.

675
00:40:44,516 --> 00:40:46,918
You go with the score answers.

676
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:48,981
You are going to get four sentences.

677
00:40:51,603 --> 00:40:52,945
And he is only circuit.

678
00:40:53,146 --> 00:40:55,367
That's why I want to know the participants who is there.

679
00:40:55,728 --> 00:41:01,135
Even if you open a moral board, there will be one one sticky that he'll place it.

680
00:41:02,735 --> 00:41:10,880
To all our communities, to me, to me, to stress me, to me, to who, who I am, to just partner, just the best three people need all the three of them.

681
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,204
To me, to me, to stress me.

682
00:41:13,905 --> 00:41:18,230
So only three people are coming and I asked him like, you do you want to, you know, whatever they invite to anybody?

683
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:20,112
This may be a laugh at this template.

684
00:41:20,152 --> 00:41:21,293
If you say, why, what?

685
00:41:21,733 --> 00:41:22,134
It's poor.

686
00:41:22,534 --> 00:41:25,416
He'll say, he's this, then he's going to challenge me.

687
00:41:25,456 --> 00:41:26,018
Yeah, we are.

688
00:41:26,577 --> 00:41:28,659
So I might say, let me put it on.

689
00:41:28,699 --> 00:41:29,440
Hold on, Rajani.

690
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:35,106
Now the conversation I know once, because TV yesterday, you, you heard, Rajani, you were there, right?

691
00:41:35,206 --> 00:41:37,389
When he said, Peshanti, give me a template.

692
00:41:37,568 --> 00:41:38,469
I'll populate it.

693
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:40,891
Then my will, my maturity go up.

694
00:41:41,851 --> 00:41:43,052
That was his question.

695
00:41:43,293 --> 00:41:46,356
I said you have maturity won't go up, but we give you a template.

696
00:41:46,737 --> 00:41:48,039
And this is not a template.

697
00:41:50,742 --> 00:41:57,213
Who can come back to me with a template if I don't get a template at what time is the session?

698
00:41:58,054 --> 00:41:59,356
Tomorrow at noon.

699
00:42:01,699 --> 00:42:04,742
But we have invite.

700
00:42:06,244 --> 00:42:09,630
But what we'll do is today, I think we need to have

701
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:13,987
I think I understand where you are going with this question.

702
00:42:14,007 --> 00:42:15,750
I think everybody understands where you're going with this.

703
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:19,938
Which is, if I get one hour with you, I'm going to give you everything that I need.

704
00:42:20,297 --> 00:42:22,782
I can tell you what the can-view target in OKR is.

705
00:42:23,503 --> 00:42:25,688
I need your product line vision.

706
00:42:25,969 --> 00:42:31,077
I need your product group OKRs, product OKRs, for links specifically.

707
00:42:31,057 --> 00:42:34,161
and we'll give them like one or two slides, one slide per.

708
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:37,364
And one more question is, we need Chris Serito there.

709
00:42:37,724 --> 00:42:41,867
If we are talking about Lena, IH and all, why is Chris missing?

710
00:42:42,367 --> 00:42:43,668
Why is Ruchit missing?

711
00:42:43,768 --> 00:42:49,894
Or at least Ruchit should have been there as a Chris, Chris is delicate, right?

712
00:42:50,074 --> 00:42:52,717
He is going to support you on those product vision.

713
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:59,563
Whatever, if Chris makes say, this is not the L2 capabilities, Ruchit has to support you and say, this is the L2 capabilities.

714
00:42:59,603 --> 00:43:01,065
Why is he missing?

715
00:43:01,045 --> 00:43:04,431
These are the people you need to think about the audience.

716
00:43:04,672 --> 00:43:08,579
As we are changing the scope, we need to get the right audience there.

717
00:43:08,679 --> 00:43:11,664
If Chris cannot be there, who is the next best person?

718
00:43:11,704 --> 00:43:12,065
Richie.

719
00:43:12,385 --> 00:43:16,072
If Richie cannot be there, we still make them optional and go forward.

720
00:43:16,454 --> 00:43:21,382
Because unless we bring Chris and Chris Smith, Chris Serito and Chris Smith,

721
00:43:21,362 --> 00:43:23,306
They will never come into an alignment.

722
00:43:23,346 --> 00:43:30,394
We need to bring them, do their case up and say, hey, you people fight it out and tell me, come out of this session with one.

723
00:43:31,076 --> 00:43:32,637
That's our victory, right?

724
00:43:32,697 --> 00:43:34,480
Because we are running with two things.

725
00:43:35,041 --> 00:43:37,143
Make them meet and talk in that session.

726
00:43:37,184 --> 00:43:38,885
They might, they might quarrel.

727
00:43:39,005 --> 00:43:39,527
It's okay.

728
00:43:40,068 --> 00:43:41,349
Mediate that discussion.

729
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:49,300
And when you come out of that discussion, we should have one list or aligned list, where we know Christmas, that Chris Serito agrees.

730
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:50,762
That is a victory.

731
00:43:50,742 --> 00:43:54,827
I want to define what is the success of the thing.

732
00:43:54,847 --> 00:44:03,976
We can just give this course and come out and we can be again talking about there are two lists or any of the problem, I'd say there is one list right now.

733
00:44:04,157 --> 00:44:07,121
Because what does Brian Rada Sahib is going to go and do?

734
00:44:07,221 --> 00:44:10,664
He'll have a separate conversation with Chris Sarito, he'll have a separate one.

735
00:44:10,945 --> 00:44:11,326
No.

736
00:44:12,166 --> 00:44:13,608
Now, Robert hits the road.

737
00:44:14,208 --> 00:44:16,692
Why are we not catching a capability list to the vision?

738
00:44:17,132 --> 00:44:19,094
Why are we not trying to get the vision right?

739
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:22,387
Thank you.

740
00:44:23,289 --> 00:44:23,771
We're not.

741
00:44:24,271 --> 00:44:30,744
The goal was to try and get as much as possible in one session, instead of having multiple sessions, but we don't have to.

742
00:44:31,025 --> 00:44:38,400
Yeah, I don't understand that, but I don't think that we're ready to go and say which one of these things do you map up to if this stuff is still being debated and being reviewed?

743
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:45,929
But I thought there was already a line meant that's how it went into Leigh Nyx.

744
00:44:45,949 --> 00:44:50,496
So I just want to remind Christmas, this is already aligned and accepted.

745
00:44:50,516 --> 00:44:52,298
So why are you changing the structure?

746
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:55,143
I want a second objective to come up.

747
00:44:55,163 --> 00:44:57,085
We have all the right people in the room.

748
00:44:57,166 --> 00:45:01,333
Why are we hesitating to ask the right questions?

749
00:45:01,313 --> 00:45:03,217
Because we're not a lingering problem.

750
00:45:03,317 --> 00:45:05,240
Can we fix the lingering issue?

751
00:45:06,003 --> 00:45:09,809
So you're trying to fix Chris Saruto's problem with the product model.

752
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:15,481
And by doing that, you're going to have an issue not, I mean, you need them to have a vision statement.

753
00:45:15,762 --> 00:45:18,648
The success for the product models, they have the vision statement.

754
00:45:18,668 --> 00:45:19,068
If

755
00:45:19,048 --> 00:45:23,916
I'll get a beautiful vision statement.

756
00:45:24,177 --> 00:45:29,085
How can a vision statement be drafted without knowing what capability they're supporting?

757
00:45:29,106 --> 00:45:30,608
Because that's the purpose, right?

758
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:35,978
In reality, they should be able to say, I am going to support this

759
00:45:35,958 --> 00:45:38,702
A, 2, and 3, and 4, I don't care which one.

760
00:45:38,862 --> 00:45:39,523
Well, yes and no.

761
00:45:39,543 --> 00:45:41,085
We've already made the decision.

762
00:45:41,264 --> 00:45:44,329
If we're made the decision to go from the bottom up, it doesn't matter nearly as much.

763
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:45,710
They know what they're targeting.

764
00:45:46,271 --> 00:45:56,827
If you're going to say that the vision statement is going to be done the right way, then we would have started with L1s and we would have gotten them to give us one that would have been used for L2s, it would have been used for L3s.

765
00:45:57,146 --> 00:46:03,635
We're starting at L3s, so what we really have is the success is that they come out with a vision statement.

766
00:46:05,184 --> 00:46:11,670
Sorry, I have to go, but you guys brainstorm it, but I need a template.

767
00:46:12,012 --> 00:46:14,333
I need a format how we are going through.

768
00:46:14,853 --> 00:46:19,418
I'm going to do some offline conversation.

769
00:46:19,518 --> 00:46:28,788
I'm trying to bring Christmas and Christmas, set it up together, whether in that call or separate, let me let me get back to you how that goes.

770
00:46:28,807 --> 00:46:30,670
So now I need to know

771
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:35,094
We have to forget which capability matrix there needs to be a key.

772
00:46:35,114 --> 00:46:39,880
At least we all agree that a product should support a capability.

773
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:44,606
Wherever it is, however it is, they should support some R&D capability.

774
00:46:45,186 --> 00:46:51,413
As long as they can articulate that in their own words, then we can match that capability in our taxonomy.

775
00:46:51,434 --> 00:46:57,179
But they need to be able to say this product was some capability.

776
00:46:57,159 --> 00:47:05,463
If that can be there in that vision template, that is what I am looking towards.

777
00:47:05,744 --> 00:47:08,130
And then we will see how to map that.

778
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:11,760
But they need to say which business capable.
