# TranscribeMCP Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality
Code MUST be maintainable, readable, and follow established patterns. Every piece of code must have a clear purpose and be documented with inline comments only when business logic is complex. Code reviews are mandatory for all changes. Refactoring is required when cyclomatic complexity exceeds 10 or when duplicate code patterns emerge. All code must follow consistent formatting and naming conventions established in the project style guide.

**Rationale**: High-quality code reduces bugs, improves maintainability, and accelerates development velocity over time.

### II. Testing Standards
Test-Driven Development (TDD) is NON-NEGOTIABLE. Tests must be written before implementation using the Red-Green-Refactor cycle. Minimum test coverage is 85% for all new code. Integration tests are required for all API endpoints and external service interactions. Performance tests must validate all stated performance requirements. Test failures block all deployments.

**Rationale**: Comprehensive testing ensures reliability, enables confident refactoring, and provides living documentation of system behavior.

### III. User Experience Consistency
All user interfaces must follow established design systems and patterns. Visual consistency across all screens and components is mandatory. User interactions must be predictable and follow platform conventions. Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) must be met for all interfaces. User feedback and error messages must be clear, actionable, and consistently formatted.

**Rationale**: Consistent UX reduces user cognitive load, improves adoption, and creates a professional product experience.

### IV. Performance Requirements
All API responses must complete within 200ms at p95. Page load times must not exceed 2 seconds. Memory usage must be monitored and optimized to prevent leaks. Database queries must be indexed and optimized for expected scale. Performance regression tests are required for all performance-critical paths.

**Rationale**: Performance directly impacts user satisfaction and system scalability. Prevention is more cost-effective than reactive optimization.

### V. Development Workflow
All changes must go through feature branches with descriptive names. Pull requests require code review approval before merging. Commits must have clear, descriptive messages following conventional commit format. Continuous Integration must pass all checks before deployment. Documentation must be updated alongside code changes.

**Rationale**: Structured workflows enable team collaboration, maintain code quality, and provide change traceability.

## Quality Standards

**Documentation Requirements**: All public APIs must have OpenAPI specifications. All modules must have README files with usage examples. Architecture decisions must be documented in ADR format. Code comments are required only for complex business logic, not for self-explanatory code.

**Security Standards**: All inputs must be validated and sanitized. Authentication and authorization must be implemented for all protected resources. Secrets must never be committed to version control. Security scanning must pass in CI/CD pipeline. OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities must be actively prevented.

**Deployment Standards**: All environments must be reproducible through Infrastructure as Code. Deployment must be automated through CI/CD pipelines. Rollback procedures must be tested and documented. Health checks and monitoring must be implemented for all services.

## Development Workflow

**Feature Development Process**: Features begin with specification creation using `/specify` command. Requirements clarification through `/clarify` when needed. Implementation planning through `/plan` command. Task breakdown through `/tasks` command. Implementation execution following TDD principles.

**Code Review Requirements**: All code changes require peer review. Security-sensitive changes require security team review. Performance-critical changes require performance validation. Breaking changes require architecture team approval. Reviews must check for constitutional compliance.

**Quality Gates**: All tests must pass before merge. Code coverage must meet minimum thresholds. Performance benchmarks must not regress. Security scans must show no high or critical vulnerabilities. Documentation must be updated for public API changes.

## Governance

Constitution supersedes all other development practices and guidelines. All pull requests and code reviews must verify compliance with constitutional principles. Complexity that violates principles must be justified in writing with documentation of why simpler alternatives were rejected.

**Amendment Process**: Constitutional changes require written proposal with rationale. Changes must be reviewed by lead developers and approved by project maintainers. Amendment implementation includes updating all dependent templates and documentation. Version increments follow semantic versioning based on change impact.

**Compliance Monitoring**: Regular constitution compliance audits are conducted quarterly. Violations are tracked and addressed in sprint planning. Repeated violations trigger process improvement discussions. New team members receive constitution training during onboarding.
